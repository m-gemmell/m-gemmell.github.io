Gemmell 2023-10-09 Chapter 1 The Aurora’s Avarice This is a monster of the week mystery. In this adventure the hunter’s go to Skifry, a troubled Canadian mountain town. It is the off season in October and work is under way to revamp the small mountain town to match the giant ski resort, The Aurora. This is all through investments by Veil resorts, a massive mountain resort company. The Daman siblings, owners of The Aurora are delighted by the investment and hope to sell the majority of their shares to retire early. Everyone else in the town are unhappy with the destruction of their snowy mountain life. Except for some who may be able to sell their houses for a high profit in the future. However, it is the Bjorksons that have caused the recent deaths. If the building of new roads goes ahead in the town their business of electric taxis and transport will go bust, as the narrow roads ban all other powered forms of transport. They will lose their monopoly. They have transformed themselves into powerful human/ice worm hybrids by the consumption of Ice Worm eggs. Additionally, they lure the one living Juvenile Ice Worm to their victims with a drone projecting lights like the Aurora Borealis. This Cult of Skyuss (Ski + Kyuss) has accomplished little by killing road construction workers. However, they have recently had a win. Whilst transporting people around town they overheard that Jeff Daman (Ski resort family) was going skiing late at night. 1.1 Suggested intro sequence Jeff Daman is on the slopes late at night. The aurora comes out causing Jeff to look at his smart watch. He shrugs and sets off down the slope. A large rumbling occurs, the snow is disturbed and Jeff screams followed by a large crunch. 1.2 Hook The Daman siblings, Ann &amp; Dan, have called the hunters to investigate the death of their brother Jeff. He was found on the ski slopes with large chunks bitten off him. These bites are large and semi-circular like that of a large shark. 1.3 Notes The cave of origins is where the ice worm eggs were found. It was uncovered by a large avalanche 9 months ago. The avalanche did not harm Skyfry or the resort. Deaths started 7 months ago. There are many undergound hot springs in the area, hence why the ice worm can survive here.

Dusk: The Bjorksons kidnap and kill Simone. Sunset: Elise the sheriff is killed by the Bjorksons using the worm as she investigates Simone’s disappearance. Nightfall: A large aurora over the resort occurs. Many people are there to witness it. As the Aurora has a mirrored surface the worm attacks and destroys it killing many. Midnight: The worm escapes to warmer climates killing many across the Americas.

However, it has some traits that belies this appearance. It is massive at 10 metres long with a circumference of 0.5 metres. It is covered in thousands of thick needle like hairs of diamond. Below these are dark purple scales. Finally, it has a circular maw filled with rows of rectangular grinding teeth made of diamond. 3.1 Powers Burrowing It burrows through snow, ice, ground, and rocks at high speeds. It consumes with its giant maw and pushes with its diamond hairs. 3.2 Attacks Bite 4 harm, 1 target, mouth range Hair scrape 2 harm, multiple targets, close range 3.3 Armour &amp; harm capacity 3 armour &amp; 10 harm capacity 3.4 Weakness Aurora attraction It is attracted to places with the Aurora Borealis lights. Otherwise it normally stays away from humans as it hunts bigger game like moose. Cryophobic Surprisingly it will die if it is too cold. Its diamond like hairs keep it insulated so destroying them will help. Ideas of what might work include: Big magic to freeze it. Getting it into a river of glacial water. An ice thrower. Encourage the imagination of your hunters on how to carry this out.

They are the only form of transport allowed in the town currently due to the narrow roads. However, their monopoly may come to an end. This company is run by the six brothers who comprise the entire cult. Igor (Black beard) Gregor (Ginger beard) Timor (Blond beard) Viktor (Grey beard) Nestor (Black peppered beard) Hektor (Purple beard) Roll a d6 to see which brother picks up the hunters each time they use the Skifry ski lifts. They found the cave of the Wrym, ate Snow worm eggs and lure the one Juvenile Ice Worm to disrupt the development. They see the worm as their weapon whilst the worm sees them as its siblings who it will not harm. However, it is a worm so it does not see the Cult as anything more than something to avoid. 4.1 Motivation They have the four below motivations depending on the scenario for them. Scout: to stalk, watch, and report. They try to get info from people as they drive people around. Cultist: to save their own skin. Machinations are to protect their business. Brute: to intimidate and attack. Will intimidate people to not help the hunter via threats of not giving transport. Will disguise themselves and attack the hunters and disrupt their investigation. Assassin: To kill the hunters If they figure out what the hunters are doing they will try to use the worm to kill them. 4.2 Appearance The 6 Bjorkson brother are all short but stout men. They wrap up well in long colourful jumpers covered by a puffer vest. Their heads are covered up by the combination of a big fluffly trapper hat and massive sprawling beard. This is easily explained as it is quite cold in the electric cars since it is too expensive to heat them. They wear sunglasses for snow blindness that allows them to hide their purple eyes. It is nearly impossible to differentiate the brothers if not for the colour of their beards. They give off a sickly sweet smell they try to mask with pine tree car air freshners and cheap cologne. 4.3 Powers Diamond interlocking bones They have near unbreakable bones. Their bones have divided into smaller but interlocking bones. This allows them to fit through very tight spaces. Increased strength Although they don’t look it their strength is similar to the strongest people in the world. Maw They have large circular mouths with rows of diamond teeth. 4.4 Weakness Coldness: They are very weak to the cold. Bright colourful lights: Will stun them into a stupor momentarily. 4.5 Attack Punch: 1 harm, hand range. Bite: 3 harm, hand range. They need to pin the hunter down. 4.6 Armour 1 armour due to some diamond patches on their skin. 4.7 Harm capacity 5 harm capacity. Although the transformation has made them stronger in ways it has also made them easier to kill due to their unnatural features. 4.8 Location: Bjorkson’s compund Deathtrap: To harm intruders This compound is found on the outskirts of Skifry. It is completely surrounded by a large fence topped with razor wire. This contains a large building that acts as: Bjorkson’s home Office Vehicle workshop Around the side and back of the house is a temporary Behind the building is a dump where all trash is temporarily held before the Bjorkson’s transport it further away. The Bjorkson’s will bring any kidnapped individuals here. "],["05-Starting_location.html", "Chapter 5 “Base camp”", " Chapter 5 “Base camp” Point of no return A large parking lot at the base of the mountain. This is where all cars and other out of town transport stop. Two of Skyfry’s Ski lifts largest vehicles are generally always waiting here, a E-minbus and an E-van. One of the Bjorkson brothers is in a small cabin waiting to use one or the other. This is the first place the hunter’s will arrive and so the first person they meet will be a Bjorkson brother. As they travel up the winding road for an hour the first thing they will see of the town of Skifry is its town symbol on a welcome to sign. If the hunters try to return to base camp before solving the mystery they will find the minibus &amp; van have “broken down”. Unfortunately the normal Ski lift taxis can’t make it down the steep road.

The Stylish brutalist architecture of the resort intensifies the beauty of the forest and mountain. Instead of concrete the boxy buildings are covered in mirrors with borders of undulating multicoloured leds, like a gamers keyboard. It must be a sight to behold when the Aurora is out. In sharp contrast the insides contain beautiful wood work all over the wooden ceilings, walls, and flooring. There are many electric fire pits. There are plenty of windows not visible to the outside as they are one way mirrors. All the amenities you can think of in a ski resort are present. As the owners, the Damans, asked for help. The hunters have each been given a premium suite with full access to amenities. It helps that it is the off season so it is quiet anyway. The place is heated by the natural hot water from the underground hot springs. 6.1 The Damans Skeptic: To deny supernatural explanations. Ann (she/her) and Dan (he/him) Daman go around wearing blue and pink robes, ready to jump in the spa or swimming pool at a moments notice. They assure the hunters they would look a lot more professional in the busy season or with important people around. They are both very blond, white and beautiful, think Barbie and Ken. Dan likes to introduce himself as Dan Da Man. Ann gets very annoyed at this and says “It’s pronounced Damon like Matt Damon, he visits every year”. They of course like to name drop famous celebrities, feel free to use real people and/or make up ones. They will brag about the large Aurora that will occur in a couple weeks. They don’t remember when as Dan kept track of those details. They are both separately and secretly embezzling. 6.2 Arnaq (she/her), head of resort security Official: To be suspicious. From an Alaskan inuit tribe, Arnaq means wolf. Arnaq has piercing eyes that always seems to be locked onto you. She is gruff but courteous. The rest of her security team will answer some easy questions but otherwise tell the hunters to speak to Arnaq. Arnaq is aware of the Damans’ embezzling and so will keep the hunters out of snooping around the hotel. 6.3 Liam (he/him) Victim: To put themselves in danger. Liam is as large as an elk. His chest hair bursts forth from the top of his plaid shirt. He could crush a watermelon with one of his large mitts. He rejoices in his strength and isn’t afraid of anything, to his peril. Liam runs the hire &amp; guide shop that is in the underground area of the resort. He will hire out snowmobiles, skis, etc. However, he will insist he guides the hunters if they explore the slopes/wilderness. He knows the mountains well and will be able to tell them about the avalanche 9 months ago and bring them to that general location. 6.4 Pluto (he/him) &amp; Jessabel (she/her) Witness: to reveal information Pluto is an older gentleman and town local who runs the Aurora’s bar during the morning and afternoon. He wears a bright yellow snow jacket. He now takes care of his granddaughter Jessabel who he cares for very much. He is also the astronomy club leader and will invite the hunters to the stargazing sessions that are run on the roof of the Aurora every night. Jeff Daman loved stargazing and bought all the fancy equipment the club uses. Some would see this as generosity but Pluto sees it as a way for Jeff to have free labour and expertise from club members. Either way it is still good for Pluto. If the hunters play with Jessabel, Pluto will reveal that all the victims dies on nights when there should not have been an aurora but an aurora was sighted anyway.

The town is a cozy Canadian town. Plenty of peaked top buildings covered in snow. Initially the town was founded due to the abundance of underground hot springs used for heat and now to generate electricity. 7.1 Church of Nyxmera A church of the Primeval deity Nyxmera. The two-faced deity of night and day. It embodies drama, loving the light (comedy) and the dark (tragedy). It is forever watching and so wants interesting events to occur. The vast majority of the town attend this church. Note: In my world this religion is normal, feel free to replace with a different church. 7.1.1 Summer Night (she/her), cleric of Nyxmera Gossip: to pass on rumours. She wears a robe, one side is bright white whilst the other is black. She is very cheery with a very dark sense of humour. 7.2 The Yert A gear shop run by the Yerts. The hunters can buy a bunch of gear here like drones, night vision goggles, snow gear etc. 7.2.1 Bob &amp; Susi Yert Witness: to reveal information They are both amenable but unwilling to discuss current events in details. They are loyal to the Bjorksons but don’t know what they are actually doing. If pressed or threatened they may reveal that the Bjorksons bought a very fancy drone a few months back. 7.3 Hospital &amp; morgue 7.3.1 Dr Mordecai Tryst (he/him), morgue man Detective: to rule out explanations. A morose tired man. Did the autopsies on the various victims. None of the bodies are with him so the hunters only have his word to go on. He doesn’t like these murders and wants them to be stopped. 7.4 Simone’s Antique’s More a pawn shop than an antique place, no matter how much Simone says otherwise. 7.4.1 Simone Victim: To put themselves in danger. Simone’s attire consists of a flowing baggy dress that glimmers like purple scales. She is obsessed with the legend of the purple dragon of Skyfry slain by the town’s founder Georges. Her story is completely wrong. But she is currently very giddy and wanting to tell people of her discovery. She is very happy to talk with the hunters and show them the tubular diamond pieces (not realising they are diamonds) that she has been buying from Mr Plum. If the hunters humour her/manipulate her well she will show them her prized possession. In her freezer she keeps a frozen scale of the snow worm which has a tubular diamond coming from it. If she shows this to the hunters she will become a target of the Bjorkson’s. 7.5 Indeginous centre A centre to display the history of indigenous tribes of Canada. 7.5.1 Charlie (they/them), curator and story teller Witness: To reveal information. A friendly story teller with many paper cuts on their fingers. They can tell the hunters many stories of various mythology and creatures. Will only tell the hunters the story of the ice worm if the hunters know it is an ice worm they are dealing with. The native Waawate &amp; Icelandic Jokla were a warlock pair of great power. They vanquished the mighty ice worm. Waawate summoned the Northern lights to attract the beast. Then Jokla encased it in ice. 7.6 Misc 7.6.1 Mr Plum (he/him) Witness: to reveal information A plumber with a large moustache and cap emblazoned with a plum. The hunters will most likely seem him multiple times around town as there are many plumbing issues. Little bits of tubular diamonds are shredding water pipes. He thinks it is is fibre optic cables somehow getting into the systems by the new internet lines that were installed. He will happily complain about this to anyone who asks. He sells them to Simone of Simone’s antiques. These bits of diamonds are coming from the Ice worm which frequents the hot springs to keep warm. Only been appearing in the last months. 7.6.2 Sheriff Elise Helper: to join the hunt Elise’s warm police uniform is immaculate. She obviously doesn’t get much work even though she would love it. She will most likely search out the hunters if they attract too much attention. She can be a good person to put suspicion on the Bjorksons by saying how they keep people quiet through transport blackmail. Elise feels she was assigned to this job because she is too competent and not corrupt enough. All she does is paperwork because the resort security do most things and get in her way. "],["08-The_mountains.html", "Chapter 8 The mountains 8.1 Ski slopes 8.2 The mountains 8.3 Cave of origins", " Chapter 8 The mountains To face down the snow worm the hunters will most likely have to traverse into the mountains. 8.1 Ski slopes Den: to harbour monsters. Snowy and forested ski slopes. This is most likely where the Snow worm will attack as it is close to town so the Bjorksons can easily use their drone from their compound. 8.2 The mountains Maze: To confuse and separate The hunters will need to traverse the mountain wilderness to get to the cave of origins. There are steep cliffs, forests, and various caves. 8.3 Cave of origins This cave is about an hour out of town via snowmobile if you know where to look. It will probably take a while to find the place but shorter if they have a guide. This is the cave where the snow worm eggs were found by the Bjorksons. In this cave they can find the broken remains of 7 eggs (6 bjorksons who each ate an egg plus the living juvenile snow worm). Feel free to add some clue as to how the snow worms got to earth here. An orange lemon by some petrified black roots in my case. "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
