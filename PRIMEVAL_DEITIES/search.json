Your masked identity represents someone of high fame or infamy. It could be a prophet of a deity, a leader of a thieves guild, a reincarnation of a dead hero etc. Your masked identity is seen by all beings and deities as a separate being to your real identity. You can start a mission without the mask on but once on it cannot be removed till the current mission ends. Anyone who saw you don the mask thinks you simply vanished and the masked identity must have come from somewhere else.\n\nBonded mask\n+1 on any one attribute based on a strength of mask identity\n-1 on any one attribute based on a weakness of your real identity\n\nPRECOGNITION: At the start of a mission roll 3 D6s and mark down each number as a foresight number. At any point you may spend and use a foresight number by changing any rolled D6 to its number. Once all three foresight numbers are used you gain a fourth foresight number. You can choose what number (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6) this fourth foresight number is when you use it.\n\nTarot deck\n+1 TACTICAL\n\nSTAR-BRAIN: Your mind is a mini-star.

Afterwards your star is in a cooled down state, you are left with 1HP, and cannot use any feature of this trait till the end of the mission.\n\n\nMetal head (accessory)\n-2 CREATIVE"

    "text": "UNDER CONSTRUCTION\nDr. Petra Pufferfish is the Primeval Polytheist and a super villain. She is the only living being favoured by all the Primeval Deities. She is especially liked by Gaia, the deity of life and unity. Her plans involve the subjugation of the world so it may finally be united under her rule. Many follow her cause. They perceive her connection to all the deities as a sign of righteousness. Her chief lieutenants are Blanchard, Kohitar, and Sol.\nAs well as being a super villain, Petra is also a super scientist. She is pedantic and hates acronyms, she won’t pronounce them correctly out of disrespect. She loves long and descriptive names for her machines and harshly criticises her lieutenants when they try to use acronyms. Curiously she dislikes the arbitrary nature of people’s names and will frequently use only the first syllable when referring to people. Of course she demands all her minions to use her full name, Dr. Petra Pufferfish.\nDr. Petra Pufferfish is an expert on genetics and cloning. She once worked for the Centre for Genomics and Cloning, frutrated by her lack of promotion. As with many egomaniacs she wants to live for ever and she has figured out how. With Blanchard’s technology she has frozen her body in such a way that allows her brain to function normally. Whilst frozen like this she makes clones of her self. Due to her genius these clones mature in weeks and have a copy of her mind. Additionally, they have an enhanced physique and powers. This cloning and gene editing requires a lot of energy which is made by Kohitar’s battery technology.\nThe clones only live for a year but she has made this a benefit. With Sol’s technology she is able to mind control her clones, as if she was inhabiting their body. They have explosive collars she can activate as she does not trust her clones when they are not being mind controlled by her."

Only the Ceremony, Dinner, and Consummation will have an assassination attempt.\nAll the events take place on the estate grounds. No maps of the estate are given so you can create your own vision with the prompts in the below descriptions.\n\nRehearsal dinner\nThe rehearsal dinner takes place the evening before the actual wedding. It will be in the same ball room described in the Dinner section. No assassination will take place but it is a prime time for the players to carry out some intel gathering on the hired shutterbugs.\n\n\nCeremony\nThe ceremony takes place outside in a area flanked by the Ruby River and a rock garden full of beautiful geodes.\nTHE KING is using one of their personas (Aurelia Blaine) to attend the wedding as an invited guest. During the rehearsal dinner she will will steal River’s wedding ring. THE KING will attempt to set their curse on River and the wedding ring. They will entertain and perform card tricks for the brides to get close to them.\nClue: Players will overhear one of the bridesmaids saying they have lost River’s ring as they recruit help from the other bridesmaids.\nIf not stopped the couple will turn into gold as Ruby puts River’s ring on during the ceremony.\n\n\nFigure skating break\nAfter the ceremony the wedding party will move onto an outdoor skating rink. Here, River’s past and present skaters (all guests to the wedding) will provide an amazing show.\nAsk each of your players for a name of one of the skaters, then ask them for a name and description of a figure skating move. Give a WAR DIE to the player with the skater and move the table agrees is best.\n\n\nDinner\nThe dinner takes place in a large ball room dominated by a central large ornate water fountain sculpted from rock. On one side of the room lay the tables for the dinner. On the other is a large stage and dance floor.\nThe dinner will consist of the speeches followed by the main meal. The brides will then cut their wedding cake which will lead to their first dance.\nThe designated shutterbug is THE ANTIDOTER. They have poisoned all the food with the first part of their poison and the entire wedding cake with the second part.\nClue: During the dinner the 2 brides will leave and a fog machine will go off before the dancing commences. This is the work of the THE ANTIDOTER.\nIf not stopped the couple will die of heart attacks during their first dance.\n\n\nEntertainment\nAfter watching the first dance, the guests will join in the festivities with drinking and dancing. Various famous bands will play on the stage.\nUnsurprisingly, Ruby is a big fan of Rock and Metal bands. Ask your players for some fictional bands that will be performing. Give a WAR DIE to the player with band name the table agrees is the best.\n\n\nConsummation\nAt the end of the night the newly wedded couple will leave the ball room and go to their private building within the estate. This building is secluded on top of a rock outcropping. It is flanked by the river and surrounding forest. One side of the building is a large glass wall that overlooks the Ruby River.\nIf the players are assassinating they must do so after the couple have entered the building but before they have consummated the wedding. In this case the building is guarded by 4 KRAKEN SECURITY GUARDS. The team will succeed if they kill both brides and partially succeed if they kill at least one.\nIf the players are stopping the assassinations, the last shutterbug is the THE SILHOUETTE. They will be parked a few miles away as they send in their 4 SILHOUETTE SHADOW CLONES to storm the private building. The clones will try to stealthily enter but are not afraid to enter a gunfight. The team will succeed if they save both brides and partially succeed if they save at least one."

The town was founded in these mountains due to the underground hot springs acting as a natural way to heat the town and produce electricity. Unfortunately, the underground hot springs are also the reason the cryophilic snow worms can so easily survive the cold climate here.\nThe Aurora, on the outskirts of the town, makes use of the hot water and town citizens.\nSome possible clues include:\n\nLibrary in the city hall: News articles about a radio tower abandoned in the 30s due to unexplained animal attacks.\nRecruiters for cult: Will try to recruit the players to the cult. They are careful and coy as they are currently normal humans.\nHospital & morgue: Recent body of a victim.\nIndigenous centre: The resident storyteller has the following story if asked about tales of worms.\n\nThe native Waawate & Icelandic Jokla were a warlock pair of great power.

The forest is a mile above the ski slopes, on top of a ridge. An old road leads to it but otherwise snow mobiles can be used to reach the outpost.\nThe outpost is a nondescript square concrete building. It consists of 2 floors with an inner outdoor square dominated by a radio tower. The outpost is surrounded by a barbed wire topped fence with one gate. Its insides and outsides are littered with detritus and garbage. The cult intentionally lets it look dilapidated so it appears abandoned.\nWhilst approaching the outpost the team may be spotted by the patrolling MUTATED CULTIST OF SKYUSS through outside facing windows on the first floor.\nInside the outpost murmurings can be heard from all directions. It is kept stiflingly hot with large radiators lining the walls. A strong musky smell permeates the entire air, somewhat covering the smell of mould and rot from all the garbage. The concrete walls are heavily cracked with sloppy patch jobs.\nA large SUV (8 HP, 1 ARMOR) is covered by the garbage outside but within the fence.\nIf the team are in active combat, make a Choke roll for Anne Lida (DEACON OF SKYUSS) every time a MUTATED CULTISTS OF SKYUSS dies.\n\nGround floor\nThe ground floor contains 6 rooms (R) with one hallway (H) circling the inner walls.

Worm specimens including eggs. 2 Ultrasonic harmonic frequency grenades are also present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadio tower room\nThis is a warm room where the Deacon of Skyuss orchestrates plans and controls their Aurora generator. It contains the radio tower controls and a ceiling hatch leading to the top of the tower.\nAnne Lida is dedicated to her cause and will never let the team stop her. However, she is trickier and smarter than the other cultists. If cornered she will most likely activate the Aurora generator to summon the snow worms as an act to distract/kill the team. She will attempt to escape via the hidden large SUV outside, grabbing some minions and snow worm eggs from her research room before she does so.\nThe DEACON OF SKYUSS (Anne Lida) Aurora generator is mounted on the top of the tower. Accessible by a metal ladder."

Their standing force consists of 1D6 TARTARUS RAIDERS, and 2 TARTARUS MUTANTS. There are many more injured and dead.\n\n\nDesperation\nEvery so often a new OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOS emerges from the magma to attack the settlement. The DOT raiders want to escape. Their own only choices are to leave via the surface or back deeper into the DOT. They know they will be captured if they go to the surface. The only way deeper into the DOT is through the Reservoir Chamber containing Taloes that will destroy them.\n\n\nNegotation\nThe raiders are willing to negotiate with the team. They will not leave the chamber until there is a safe route to the DOT. Additionally, they won’t leave the surface route unguarded. They initially let the team through the Overlook Chamber unharmed so they could parley.\nAxel will offer the following weapon as immediate payment if the team agrees to take care of the Taloes in the Reservoir Chamber.\nPanzerschreck Rocket launcher (1D6+2 DAMAGE, LOUD)\nLOUD weapon tag: Attacks with this weapon draw the undivided attention of enemies within earshot (and instantly reveal your position).\nIf the players try to negotiate Axel may also offer one or both of the following:\n\nReinforced silver fire suit (1 ARMOR)\nLending the players a TARTARUS MUTANT for the fight ahead\n\nIf the players agree, the raiders will pack their goods and injured into their vehicles so they are ready to escape through the Reservoir Chamber. Before the team leave Axel will inform them that the Taloes took some live recon agents and raiders, totalling 6, into the Reservoir Chamber. They also warn that once the Taloes are slain this part of the DOT will start to crumble and the team will need to be ready to retreat back to the surface. If they are not quick enough the caves will collapse and the new entrance of the DOT will disappear preventing their escape."

As the team enters they hear the screams of recon members and raiders being hurled into the magma mote. The caves start to shake as the magma flow increases in speed. Each Talos starts creating a smaller obsidian pillar at the 6 edges of the large pillar. If their ritual is not stopped the volcano will reawaken. The village of Warboy will be destroyed and England will be blanketed in a volcanic fog.\n\n\nCombat\nDuring combat the Taloes like to carry out 2 main tactics. Create cover with the abundance of lava and throw their spears whilst defended. Conversely, some will charge their enemies with arm blades.\nIf 6 OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES is not enough for the challenge you would like, more can emerge from the central magam mote."

    "section": "Clues",
    "text": "Clues\nThere are various clues that can help the team figure out what is going on. Please include your own if you would like.\n\nSightings & attacks\nThe FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS are sighted in many areas but there is a noticeably higher amount near hospitals and graveyards. They have also been sighted, stalking the sick and elderly.\nSurprisingly they are not that violent, seemingly only attacking when provoked. However, there are some humans they have attacked without provocation. If the team looks up the victim’s health records they will see that most were diagnosed with gout. This is because Farrier has been tortured by Dr. Ranga Doshi in the past and she remembers the smell of gout on him.\n\n\nFood poisoning\nA local restaurant, famous for only serving shellfish based meals is being closed down by the police as patrons have died of food poisoning. Some victims who were admitted to Yan Oi Tong (The University Of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Centre For Training And Research) are being successfully treated. Those who went to North Lantau Hospital or Tung Chung Health Centre did not survive.\nIf they confront the owner or get information from the police they will find out the owner has been serving the HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT meat. Their usual supply of canned horseshoe meat currently has a shortage. Unknown to them their supply was from the CGC who’s prized spawner (Farrier) escaped.\nIf the team successfully investigates at Yan Oi Tong they will find out the patients were treated for pufferfish poisoning (tetrodotoxin). One of the CGC scientists gave this advice to one of the doctors.\n\n\nMedical conference\nA medical conference was in force at one of Tung Chung’s hotels. Many medical researchers and doctors are now stuck during the quarantine. This keeps the nicest hotel out of the hands on evacuees and the military which they are more than happy to grumble about.\nThe large conference room has been changed into a disaster relief zone with many makeshift beds. The occupants are using the leftover posters as extra blankets. One poster is about Horseshoe crabs and how their blood is harvested to create compounds to help test vaccines. It was being presented by a PhD student of Dr. Ranga Roshi, based at Yan Oi Tong (The University Of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Centre For Training And Research).\n\n\nEnvironmental scientists\nEnvironmental scientists are trying to map out the diversity of the island. They have been keeping track of the HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS movements. The player’s team may find them following the mutants around the Tung Chung and even outside of it, sneaking through a construction zone at the edge of the town.\nThe scientists have deduced they are some sort of hybrid between Atlantic horseshoe crabs and Mangrove horseshoe crabs. They have also deduced that the mutants are coming from the Mangrove forest west of Tung Chung. This is where Farrier is located.\n\n\nClogged sewers\nThere are issues with the sewers being clogged. This is due to the roe of the BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT accumulating in the sewers. This is also where the FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS hatch and emerge from."

The CGC are powerful and the Hong Kong military and police will not take kindly to the team openly investigating them.\nDr. Doshi’s team carries out research in a hidden and secure floor below the basement of the Yan Oi Tong (The University Of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Centre For Training And Research). Although they can speak Cantonese, they are so secretive they communicate and write in Hindi within the lab. The CGC specifically sent a Hindi team to Hong Kong for this reason.\n\n\nYan Oi Tong (The University Of Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Centre For Training And Research)\n\n\nDr. Ranga Doshi\nDr. Ranga Doshi is a well respected scientist of the CGC. He is a tired man with a limp due to his gout. He takes great care of his team and is a very likable man. However, he hates animals and enjoys inflicting pain on them. He is smart and hides his zoosadism, except when it comes to arthropods. He loves eating animals, especially shellfish. The only non meat food he eats are carb-based foods such as rice and bread to eat along with meat.\nHe is normally found in one of 6 places:\n\nHis office: Taking calls, having one-on-one meetings, researching, preparing lectures etc. He can also be found sleeping in a temporary cot.\nPatrolling the lab: Although a nice boss in ways he tends to micromanage and change his mind often.\nTeaching: He gives lectures and tutorials within the lecture theatres and labs of the main hospital.\nMingling: He will go to the hotel hosting the medical conference to mingle with other medical researchers.\nRestaurants: He always eats at restaurants.\nSpawning pen: He sometimes likes to find a newly spawned MUTANT HORSESHOE CRAB to torture alone.\n\nOutside of his research lab he is always escorted by two CGC SECURITY members.\n\n\nCGC staff\nDr. Doshi’s team consists of 2 types of staff:\n\nCGC SCIENTISTS: Members of his research team.\nCGC SECURITY: Security to keep people out and the specimens in the lab.\n\nThe team can be found in the main hospital from time to time. The scientists help tutor students. All the staff take their breaks in the canteen and recreational rooms of the main hospital. Currently some are sleeping in the main hospital due to the quarantine and martial law.\n\n\nResearch\nThe team carries out research and experiments on:\n\nAtlantic horseshoe crabs: collected for blood harvesting.\n\nThe blood contains amebocytes which are used to create LALs, used to test vaccines.\n\nMangrove horseshoe crabs: contain tetrodotoxin.\n\nLethal neurotoxin, the same that makes pufferfish, and blue-ringed octopuses so deadly.\nIf used correctly it can also be used as a treatment of cancer-associated pain.\nMay also be able to be used as a recreational drug, as seen by dolphins who get high on it via pufferfish.\n\n\nThe team genetically engineered the HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS. They have carried this out to get a variety of uses from them.\n\nFEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS\n\nBlood harvested for LALs\nRoe is sold as food\nSome used to spawn more HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS\nOnce no longer of use they are killed and their tetrodotoxin is harvested\n\nMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS\n\nFertilisers\nSold as meat as they do not contain tetrodotoxin\n\n\nThe team have also created a toxin that only kills the HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS. Dr. Doshi initially does not want to use it as it will taint the island’s water supply and most likely make its way into their research lab, killing their specimens.\n\n\nResearch floor\nThe CGC research floor is a large hallway branching off like a trident from the elevator. All rooms have large windows that allow a generous view into and from the hallway.\nThe CGC SCIENTISTS primarily work in the:\n\nResearch rooms: Tables with computers and notes along with a library of medical & zoology textbooks.\nDissection lab: Room to study the anatomy of Horseshoe crabs and the mutants.\nTetrodotoxin extraction: The scientists carry out tetrodotoxin extraction as it is too technical for the security staff.\n\nThe CGC SECURITY patrol the halls and work within the following rooms:\n\nSpawning pen: Contains 6 dedicated cages for FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS to produce new spawn. One cage has been ripped apart from the inside.\nHarvesting room: Along the walls are tied up FEMALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS. Tubes are collecting their dark blue blood.\nRoe prep: Roe are passed through a fine-mesh screen, salted and packed into metal tins, ready for sale.\nMeat prep: Males are cleaned and cut. The meat is then shredded, refrigerated, and sent to a canning company.\n\nThere are no recreational rooms, staff having to use other floors for this. There are 2 toilets but one is out of service as it was ripped off the floor when the BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT escaped. The exposed pipe has been blocked."

It produces an abundance of offspring with 4 MALE HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS that were on its back when it escaped the lab.\nThe Mangrove forests are wetlands in coastal intertidal zones. They are named for the Mangroves that inhabit them. They are incredibly wet making travel by car or foot very difficult.

If she is killed the hivemind will break and cannot be reformed. This will cause all the remaining HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANTS to become unintelligent and unorganised creatures that can be easily dealt with by the Hong Kong military. With this option the team may be able to talk with Dr. Doshi to gain his help in their plan. If, so and they successfully kill Farrier, he will reward the team with a choice of either a CGC body serum or a CGC mind serum\n\n\nHelp Farrier\nThe other method is to help Farrier, the BROODING HORSESHOE CRAB MUTANT. If the team encounters her she will telepathically communicate with them. She will ask they help her free her kin from the CGC. If they do, she will leave the island to go live within the oceans. She will reward the team with a blessed barnacle.\nBlessed barnacle: Once per mission attach the barnacle surface to a hard surface. This causes many tennis ball sized barnacles to cover the surface. This may strengthen the surface and make it more climbable.\n\n\nMission completion\nAs long as they rid the islands of the MUTANT HORSESHOE CRAB infestation the team’s employer (Pumice construction) will be happy. They will reward the team with:\nType 79 submachine gun (1D6+1 DAMAGE, LIGHT)\nLIGHT weapon tag: Weighs almost nothing. Grants +1 on REFLEXIVE rolls that involve this weapon. (F:UE)"

These sites are heavily guarded due to the contents but also to stop DOT raiders and kaiju from reaching the surface via the mouth into and out of the DOT.\nThis site was originally the Big Hole open pit quarry. However, once they found the mouth into the DOT it was developed into a dump yard. They made the hole wider and now it is used to remove the vast majority of hazardous trash for the CAC and some neighbouring countries. It is run by Carafe, a subsidiary company of Kraken.\nThe team are provided with a floppy disk by the DOT raiders to disable the security systems including automated turrets. However, it will also disable the Kaiju Sonic Disruption System (KSDS). When/if this occurs small kaiju, SCORPIUS, will rush into the dumping site only to be followed by a massive kaiju, PYTHON. PYTHON consists of three gigantic serpents connected by a giant obsidian orb.\nDouble twist, this was a plan by The Mooners to test out their CARGO MECHA against a real kaiju. Once PYTHON emerges the KSDS will reactivate, stopping further kaiju from leaving the DOT. The team will be able to pilot CARGO MECHAS hidden within cargo crates to stop the kaiju. There will also be back-up rods from god on hand if the CARGO MECHAS fail."

    "text": "The Big Hole dump yard\nThe dump yard is a large circular hole with sheer vertical walls. Dark, noisy, deep, and hot it is easy to forget you can look up at the sky. There are only two ways in and out, the Elevator and the Mouth.\nEmbedded into the cliff wall are cranes used to move cargo crates. These cargo crates fill up most of the space giving The Hole a feeling of a subterranean cargo dock. Seagulls squawk but the salt smell is replaced with that of damp, rot, and chemicals.\n\nThe Elevator\nAt the north of the hole is a large open elevator going from the surface to the bottom of the pit. It is primarily used to move loaded cargo crates down, fill of trash, and empty crates back up. So utilitarian is the elevator that passengers are transported up and down in a designated cargo crate.\nAt the surface, near the elevator, lie many train tracks and container cranes. It runs 24/7 with many trains coming and going.\nThe elevator is slow and takes a long time to go up or down. It makes up for this by being able to transport 20,000 cargo crates at a time.\n\n\nThe Mouth\nAt the south of the hole is a large cave. Within this is a Mouth of Tartarus, an entrance to the DOT. The mouth is a pitch black circle that lays completely flat to the earth. Remote controlled machines tip trash filled cargo crates into the mouth, the operators at a safe distance on the second floor of the Node.\n\n\nThe Node\nThe node is a large 5 story cylindrical building in the very centre of the Big Hole. Blacked out Windows line the entire circumference, with bright white concrete it gives off the appearance of a striped vase. Another post-modern brutalist building, walls within the building either curve parallel to the circumference or run radially.\nThe Node acts as the main building for staff with security increasing as you go up the floors. There are no stairs instead a single pill shaped elevator in the centre of the building provides access to the floors. However, this elevator requires a pair of security cards, requiring at least 2 passengers at a time.\n\nGround floor\nReception, museum, and canteen (Level 1 security)\nThe entrance of the building contains a reception and a small museum about The Big Hole and the Carafe company. It is all boring, sterile corporate propaganda. It shows how proud the company is to have automated defences to resist DOT raider and kaiju incursions.\nA large room at the back contains a canteen for the staff.\n\n\n1st floor\nLiving quarters and recreation rooms (Level 1 security)\nVarious recreation rooms with tvs, games tables, and libraries. It is a surprisingly still place, employees taking a reprieve from the exhausting labour. They live in these quarters for 14 days whilst working, then go to their homes until they want/need to work another shift.\nA separate section for security guards requires a pair of Level 3 security passes to access.\n\n\n2nd floor\nOperations and engineering (Level 2 security)\nWhere the real work in the building is done. Team leaders congregate to meet and coordinate the day to day running.\nCrane operators work within booths, remote controlling the cranes.\nThere are also workrooms for engineers to fix smaller issues and help other engineers via radio. These rooms contain many tools and manuals.\n\n\n3rd floor\nManagement (Level 3 security)\nOffices for any important members of staff. Contains a few penthouses for visiting VIPs. Furnished with expensive paintings specifically designed to fit along the curved walls.\n\n\n4th floor\nSecurity (Level 3 security)\nThis floor contains the command room for security. From here the 2 security co-heads, Arno and Lindewe watch over the CCTV cameras and relay orders to the rest of security. This same room contains all the various terminals related to the defenses. This is where the floppy disk will need to be used.\nOther rooms include contains an armoury, gym, and practice shooting range."

The terminal screen will show a map of the Hole with a position marked with a red crescent moon, towards the south west. It will instruct their mission has changed and they must kill the invaders from the DOT. They must use what is in the cargo crates marked with the flag of The Moon, a red crescent moon on a white background. Haste is urged. Of course, if any members want to stay in the Node to reactivate and use the defenses they shoudl be allowed to try.\nSoon massive amounts of SCORPIUS will escape from from the DOT and infest the site. This will keep the security guards busy and make the team’s trek to the designated spot dangerous.\nIf they successfully arrive at the crates they will find one for each team member, this is also a good place for emergency insertions. Within each crate is a CARGO MECHA that will take the team member as its pilot. Now the team have a chance against the kaiju.\nAfter some combat with the swarm of SCORPIUS a large rattle will sound from the Mouth. This will cause the kaiju to instantly flee but many close to the cave will be decimated as PYTHON emerges. The team will be informed the mission is to eradicate it. Thankfully no more kaiju will emerge as the KDS warning ceases.\nThe team will be informed a Rod from God satellite is moving into position above the Hole. They will be able to fire this every 10 actions, or alternative option of your choice, but will need to use the handheld laser targetters within their mechas to aim it. Each Rod from God attack does 3D6+3 DAMAGE with the ANTI-MATERIAL tag (Deals double DAMAGE to vehicles and structures; cumbersome to carry around (F:UE)).\nThe site is littered with stacked cargo containers acting as obstacles to movement. Many contain hazardous, flammable, and explosive materials. Use these as the referee and players see fit.\nAdditionally, there are also large cargo cranes that could be used by the team to pin or harm PYTHON."

This is due to the erosive impacts of atmospheric particles.\nSol was a Brazilian astronaut, carrying out research upon the high orbit USA space station “Laser-US”.

This was part of a worldwide effort with the “Las-ERA”, “Laser-CAC”, “La-SAE”, and “Laser-Oceania” all in development.\nDuring their time on the Laser-US a laser experiment they were carrying out went wrong. This led to the station exploding, with everyone but Sol dying on it. Sol was able to exit the station on an escape pod.\nThis too went disastrously wrong as the pod burnt up. Sol survived but came out ablated, a smooth human with no hair or recognisable features. The US government blamed Sol for the accident, firing them, and discrediting their work. Now Sol only wants to make them regret that.\nSince their ablation, Sol has taken an interest in mind control. Dr. Petra Pufferfish, subsequently recruited Sol as one of her chief lieutenants for their expertise in Lasers and mind control.\nSol’s plan to help with world domination involves holding the USA to ransom. This will involve using asteroid laser ablation to have meteorites strike certain cities.\n\nSol Doppelgangers\nSol is able to implant their will into another human by replacing the victim’s eyes with their own. One eyes has blue sclera with a yellow iris whilst the other has black sclera with a purple and grey iris. This human is then known as a Sol Doppelganger. Sol is able to regrow his eyes in one day.\nThe Doppelganger still retains a lot of its personality but works whole heartedly to benefit Sol and will be called Sol. It also gains powers related to given title by Sol.\n\nSOL:DOPPELGANGER OF DESERTS leads the Doppelgänger Dunes"

You may enter and subsequently leave in the past, present or future no matter how long you were in the DOT. Many fantastical creatures live in the DOT. Stories of those lucky enough to escape harken back to tales and myths like Journey to the Centre of the Earth, Narnia, the Fey Wild, The Underdark and many more.\nWorld governments use the DOT as a dumping ground for garbage, scientific waste, and nuclear waste. This has lead to mutated humans and creatures due to the combination of radiation, chemicals, and the nature of the DOT. They mostly stay contained in the DOT but occasionally cause havoc on the surface. Currently Kaiju reign over Japan after the 2 nuclear bombings in WWII."
