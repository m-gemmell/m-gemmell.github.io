From afar the settlement blends into the sky due to the teal coloured bricks that make up the walls and citadel. These building blocks of clay are incredibly strong and cause the internal temperature of the castle to stay at a splendid cool temperature all year round. This is enjoyed by all locals and visitors.\nThe ground hall of the citadel is dominated by a great hall.

Apart from shelter the citizens also make use of the caves’ water. A hallowed fountain sits prominently as the centre piece of the Bailey. The site was chosen due to its inexplicable existence.\nThe fountain’s water never stops flowing and many say it will outlive even the realm. Little is known about the marble fountain’s origins with its carved imagery of fairies and pond weeds indicating it belonged to a long forgotten time. The townspeople treasure it as they use the impossibly pure and clear water for pottery and paint making.\n\n\n\nThere are many potters, creating all sorts of ceramics such as bricks, tableware, and vases. The pottery is known for its strength and simple beauty. However, a rift amongst the potters has recently occurred.\nWhere once only blue clay was used, now new artists are using red clay.\n\nThe Gaulters believe the blue clay is calming and that the red clay should be left for the land, so life can grow on it.\nThe Rusthands say that blue clay is now hard to find and therefore too expensive, preventing new potters from starting their craft.\n\n\n\n\nThe citadel boasts amazing paintings of people. All across the realms the paintings are praised and coveted for the life likeness of its subjects. Unfortunately this is due to their use of minimum (red lead) that leads to lead poisoning in the preparers and artists.\nChronic poisoning displays as agitation, irritability, vision disorders, hypertension, and a grayish facial hue. Older skilled painters are kept on the 1st floor of the citadel where they only use blue candles to light the rooms (hiding their grey facial hues). They only paint in the sun room, believing sunlight is the best light for skin.\n\n\n\nDue to the location on a peninsula the dwelling is able to trade with other realms via the sea. Currently there is much jubilation about spiced cakes. Otherwise they eat various plant foods and seafood.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately the holding is always hit with a massive storm, known as brickfall, at the start of Tithe. The citizens hide in the caves until the 2 day storm passes at which much damage will have occurred to the wooden homes due to various bricks from the wall and citadel falling on them. Overall the walls provide more safety as a windshield than destruction but many believe not enough is done to prevent bricks from falling.\nThis has led to 2 sides in the leaders of the dwelling who also act as the seat of power.\nThe Repairers faction believe things are best as they are.

    "text": "Pronounced: Back-or-dill\nEtymology: Bochord is old english for library, aill is irish for cliff\nLocation: R1-C5\nImportance: Library and protection from invaders from the north (The Eminent Realm)\n\nThe Tower of Bochordil is roughly cut out of the cliff face of a crag. It is easy to miss if you don’t know its location.\n\n\nThe bailey of Bochordil fits in a perfectly cylindrical cut out of the crag. T he cut out runs from the top of the crag to a perfectly level circle on the ground. No one knows how this occurred but many people believe it was through divine intervention.\n\n\n\nThe holding’s base is not quite a perfect circle with the imperfection caused by the space that allows escape from the holding. There lies a two doored gate, as tall as three men and as thick as a mule from nose to tail. It is made from a__deep purple metal__ only occasionally found in rocks that have dropped from the heavens and other mysterious structures. Atop the gate there are always guards wary of invasion from the north.\n\n\n\nIn the centre of the Bailey lies a tall but thin triangular based pyramid. Made of the same deep purple metal as the gate it is seen as a divine gift. It is used as a church for the Emerald Lights. The religious leader of this holding is Salvia the Sage.\n\n\n\nThe Tower of Bochordil is known as The Transposed Tower. Rather than the tower being a cylindrical structure with empty space around it, the tower’s rooms are carved into the rock surrounding the empty space of the cylindrical bailey. The Transposed Tower’s windows looking over the bailey and its dominating temple.\nThere are various floors filled with books and scholars. There is only one door for entry from the bailey that leads directly into the throne room.\nIn the throne room lies a throne that would be called plain if it were not made entirely out of emerald. The walls of the room itself are plastered with large pages depicting maps, treaties, and stories.\nSitting upon the throne is The Moat Knight, always reading and writing even when speaking or listening to others. Always at their service is their apprentice The Rune Knight, managing the tactical affairs as The Moat Knight manages the strategic.\nThe Mule Knight studied at The Transposed Tower and has strong connections with the Knights and scholars there.\nOnly The Moat Knight, The Rune Knight, or Salvia the Sage can grant access to the library of the Tower.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately their location’s geography does not promote food production and so they mostly rely on fermented fish from the fishing in the south east peninsula. The denizens set up the holding as a brilliant choke point to repel the constant invasions of The Eminent Realm who would use it as a perfect staging ground for a war with The Excised Realm. People stay for the accumulated knowledge or the holy structure.\n\n\n\nThere are spies of other realms in The Transposed Tower. The Moat Knight and The Rune Knight know this. They have their own spies bribe them with their knowledge to share knowledge of the other realms.\nMost importantly the spies/scholars of The Transposed Tower are able to make an intoxicating mead that is made nowhere else due to their access to Trillium wellsii.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the top of the crag is the only occurrence of the flower Trillium wellsii (H.G Wells wrote War of the Worlds). It has three curling stems that connect to one head with 3 petals. The Petals are a deep dark iridescent colour and on closer inspection look almost glass like.\nBees are kept at the top of The Transposed Tower giving them access to the flowers. The honey of these bees are used to create the intoxicating mead.\nAfter drinking the mead you have lucid dreams that you remember with utmost clarity. Unfortunately you forget everything you did whilst you were drunk and are very likely to answer all questions truthfully.\nThis is made with normal bees that use the pollen from a flower that came from the heavens.\nThe bee’s royal jelly is also used to create a flawless floral perfume that is used to trade with other realms.\n\n\n\n\nHolding features dark gate\nBailey includes majestic temple\nKeep holds throne with jewels decor\nFood is fermented fish\nGoods are secretive mead\nLuxuries are flawless fragrance\nDrama involves greed and disguise\nWoe is ongoing invasion\nNews of festival mood sceptical",

The Transposed Tower’s windows looking over the bailey and its dominating temple.\nThere are various floors filled with books and scholars. There is only one door for entry from the bailey that leads directly into the throne room.\nIn the throne room lies a throne that would be called plain if it were not made entirely out of emerald. The walls of the room itself are plastered with large pages depicting maps, treaties, and stories.\nSitting upon the throne is The Moat Knight, always reading and writing even when speaking or listening to others. Always at their service is their apprentice The Rune Knight, managing the tactical affairs as The Moat Knight manages the strategic.\nThe Mule Knight studied at The Transposed Tower and has strong connections with the Knights and scholars there.\nOnly The Moat Knight, The Rune Knight, or Salvia the Sage can grant access to the library of the Tower.",

Fighting humans she is poised and will never strike those who have surrendered. Against beasts and monsters she will not stop till they or her are dead.\nAt court she wears her jade gambeson dress showing her flowing silver hair. However, her helm with her long mail hood is never far. She speaks with a flat voice to disguise her emotions. She deeply cares for the people of the realm and doesn’t agree with The Ghoul Knight.\nThe War Knight knows the ginger child that The Ghoul Knight holds hostage is not her real child. Her real child was stolen by The Burning Mother and so The War Knight’s child is The Child in the myth. Although she knows the myth hex location she does not go near, nor easily share the info, in case The Ghoul Knight interferes.\nThe War Knight wants the truth but is self bound by her knightly oath.",
