They yell their sharp pitches for a variety of reasons. They concuss any predatory birds foolhardy enough to hunt them. They make beautiful melodies to attract mates and use their volume to scare off the competition. But possibly most important of all, through their mastery of pitch and recreating any sound imaginable they can play the key song of the leaves of the forked groundsels.\n\nThe leaves of the forked groundsels act as super precise tuning forks. Each leaf has a specific tone, pitch, and decibel that will activate it. Once activated the leaf will frantically vibrate and eventually fall off the tree. These forked leaves are a major source of nutrition for the forked lyrebirds."

A cacophony of whistles are made by smooth cavity covered rocks.\nDue to the winds and bareness of the land little life used to live here. It is where the Resistance have set up base, Amazonia’s drones unable to enter the area due to the tempest. Recent changes have also made it slightly more hospitable.\nWhen the PCs enter the Windwoods their best course of action is to find the Resistance."

    "text": "Yaga’s Yeti’s were formed quickly after the theft of the Central Island in the Skywoods. Yaga was asked to lead the Yeti partisans many times by Patty & Paddy but he wanted to work with and protect his Grandma Bab. With the theft of his home and Bab helping the PCs team Yaga knew he had to fight back too.\nHowever, although Yaga is strong he has not been a leader before and has a lot to learn. His first mission to investigate the Fossil reef goes wrong (see YAGA RESCUE MISSION). Depending on how the mission goes Yaga may become a true leader with a Flying racoon he named Missile as a team mascot.\nAlthough the Yeti partisans like and respect Yaga they start off not obeying his orders well. This is not out of malice but instead their tendency to rush into fights, guns blazing and axes swinging. They may learn the importance of teamwork and tactics whilst they are bound to the Abyssal buttercups."
