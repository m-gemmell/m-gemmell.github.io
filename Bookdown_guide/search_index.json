Gemmell 2023-03-03 Chapter 1 MG Bookdown Guide This is a quick and dirty guide on how I use bookdown. It is primarily for my use but if someone else finds it I hope it will also proof useful. Additionally, this was made with R Bookdown. 1.1 Intro R bookdown uses Rmarkdown. First learn some Rmarkdown then learn bookdown. SOme useful links are below. R bookdown website: https://bookdown.org/ R bookdown book: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ Cheatsheets to find r markdown cheatsheet: https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ Minimal bookdown template: https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown-demo I generally write and do everything in RStudio. F7 to spell check in rstudio 1.2 Create bookdown html Set working directory to directory with all the r markdowns. Change name to the file name that starts with 01 or the index file if you have it. bookdown::render_book(&quot;01-XX.Rmd&quot;, &quot;bookdown::gitbook&quot;) HTMLS found in \"_book\" directory Need to run render_book command to update any changes Easiest way I find is to have 1 page per chapter File names need to start with a number to show order 01-, 02-, 03- etc 1.3 Section part To create a section part you can add the following to the top of a page. # (PART\\*) Name {-} 1.4 Appendix You can create an appendix from one or multiple pages. Ensure the first page of your appendix has the following at the top: # (APPENDIX) Appendix {-} 1.5 YAML files You will need to edit some YAML files _bookdown.yml : Good to change the \"book_filename:\" _output.yml : Good to change the \"before:\" text to what you want. I turn off a lot of things so readers do not have a lot of buttons I don't want them to have I set \"split_by:\" set to \"rmd\" so there is a html page for each rmd file. More info: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/output-formats.html https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/yaml-options.html https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/bookdown-output.html 1.6 Web exercises The R package webexercises is useful to include MCQs and other functions in your bookdown. You will need to initialise this which is below the MCQ and expand example. For more functions please see the following page. 1.6.1 MCQ example Example code chunk: ```{r, echo = FALSE} opts_p &lt;- c(&quot;__A1__&quot;, &quot;__A2__&quot;, answer=&quot;__A3__&quot;) ``` 1. Question? `r longmcq(opts_p)` Question? A1 A2 A3 1.6.2 template ```{r, eval = FALSE} opts_p &lt;- c(&quot;__ __&quot;, &quot;__ __&quot;, &quot;__ __&quot;) ``` `r longmcq(opts_p)` 1.6.3 Expandable help box example `r hide(&quot;Title&quot;)` Contents `r unhide()` Title Contents 1.6.4 Initalising You first need to add web exerices to your bookdown (only needs doing once). Run below in your bookdown dir library(&quot;webexercises&quot;) add_to_bookdown(bookdown_dir = &quot;.&quot;, include_dir = &quot;www&quot;, script_dir = &quot;scripts&quot;, output_format = &quot;gitbook&quot;) If like me you don't use an index.rmd file and instead use your \"01-XX.Rmd\" as the first page you will need to delete the resulting \"index.rmd\" file. Then you need to add in the below to your \"01-XX.RMD\" file just below the block with the title, author etc. ```{r cite-packages, include = FALSE} # automatically create a bib database for R packages # add any packages you want to cite here knitr::write_bib(c( .packages(), &#39;bookdown&#39;, &#39;webexercises&#39; ), &#39;packages.bib&#39;) ``` To make the MCQs have nice boxes around the text change the webex-radiogroup label to the below. This is found in ./www/webex.css .webex-radiogroup label { /*Text colour*/ color: : #aaaaaa; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 0.25em; text-indent: -1em; padding-left: 0.5em; font-weight: 400; display: block; /*Set border of text to solid and dark grey*/ border: 2px solid #1d1d1d; border-radius: 0.25em; /*Set colour in box to white so works for every bookdown colour scheme*/ background: white; } 1.7 Embed YouTube URLS Handy guide: https://www.h3xed.com/web-development/how-to-make-a-responsive-100-width-youtube-iframe-embed Add the following to your style.css .container { position: relative; width: 100%; height: 0; padding-bottom: 56.25%; } .video { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Add the following code to where you want the URL to be embedded. Change the link to the embed link of your video. &lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt; &lt;iframe src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/U_RkeDVU2cg&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen class=&quot;video&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt; 1.8 style.css code to make page wider Add code to your bookdown's \"style.css\" file .book .book-body .page-wrapper .page-inner { max-width: 1000px !important; } 1.9 Create one page html book Add the following to _output.yml bookdown::html_book: split_by: none css: style.css toc: false Run the following command in the book dir to render bookdown::render_book(&quot;01-XX.Rmd&quot;, &quot;bookdown::html_book&quot;, output_dir = &quot;one_file_book&quot;) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed). You may want to try searching to find the page's new location, or use the table of contents to find the page you are looking for. "]]
