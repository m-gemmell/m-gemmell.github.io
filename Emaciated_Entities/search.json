The groundskeeper, Issy (she/her) (Issabella), has recruited the investigators to help. She let six individuals enter the gardens after dark. They came to study the old bell, but something went wrong.\nAfter leaving the six, Issy heard an immense ringing that rattled her soul. She found no one at the bell and she has an itch at her neck she can’t get rid of. Not wanting to phone the cops because she shouldn’t let people in after dark, especially for money she pockets herself, she contacts one of the investigators she knows.\nOnce the investigators have arrived at the Old Bell they wil not be able to escape the gardens until they have completed The Bell Ritual. To complete the ritual they must find The Guillotined and help them communicate to acquire the ritual steps.\n\n\nThe sections of this mystery are:\n\nPrelude: Narration prelude to set the scene.\nConnections: Information on Issy and the humans The Guillotined used to be so the investigators can have connections to them.\nThe Bell ritual: The ritual the investigators must perform to escape the garden.\nThe Guillotined: The six changed individuals.

    "text": "The Sticky Crawl is a method to create mystery/adventure locations with the following features:\n\nLocations are represented by sticky notes with 1-4 exits (matching the sticky note sides).\nThe layout of the locations is organic with random sticky notes being placed as the investigators use exits.\nThe locations of each investigator is tracked by a token (e.g. dice, meeples, coins etc.). NPCs and monsters can also be tracked by tokens. Tokens are used to show which location an entity (investigator/NPC/monster) is in but not necessarily where in the location they are.\nEach location is not randomly made, instead the “pool” of locations are bespoke to the mystery.\n\nThe Sticky crawl has been designed for Liminal horror as it ties well to horrorific and liminal spaces. Of course it can be adapted and used for any system.\n\n\nWhy run or create a Sticky crawl instead of other methods?\nReasons include:\n\nSticky crawls are quick and interactive for the Facilitator and Players.\n\nFacilitators do not need to print out a map. Instead, they draw each location on a sticky note as each location appears.\nPlayers decide which exits to use and not to use, partially determining how the locations spread out.\n\nUsing ephemeral sticky notes intentionally encourages an art style that is easy and quick to imitate.\n\nAs someone who’s technical art skills are low it is nice to be able to make lo-fi images with purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a brief summary of how to carry out a Sticky Crawl as the Facilitator.\n\n\nOnce the investigators have entered the area set down the first location. This may be a specific starting location or randomly chosen from the initial pool of locations.\nBelow the facilitator has started with the entrance of the museum the mystery will take place in. There are 3 exits to other locations, the lines on the left, top, and right of the sticky note. Tokens are placed in the location for the three investigators; Adam, Axel, and Blaze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a group of investigators moves through an exit a location from a valid pool is added. Generally a new location is decided by rolling a dice matching the maximum number of locations in the pool.\nWhen placing a new location:\n\nEnsure the new location connects to the previous location via an exit.\nOrient the location to keep as many exits of the new location unblocked as possible.\n\nWhen randonly determining a location, if the location is not available:\n\nChoose the next available location in descending order (e.g 6 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1).\nIf there are none available with a lower number choose the next in ascending order.\nIf there are no locations available the investigators cannot use the exit.\n\nBelow, Adam and Axel use the exit on the left.

This allow investigators to travel between locations. When travelling between two locations the locations must be touching each other’s sides and both the sides must have an exit. The cinnection between two locations can be a door, a path, a road, etc.\nPool: A pool of locations is a set of locations that can be randomly drawn from.

Below the bell are seven concentric rings like ripples in the dirt. 6 sets of footprint leading away from the bell scar the once perfect circles.\n\nThe bell is a striking bell, it has no clapper and must be struck with an external instrument. Stirking it lets out a reverberating gong.\nStriking the bell causes 2 effects:\n\nThose who strike the bell suffer 1 stress per ring.\nThe striker chooses a location (sticky note) without any investigators (if any). This location is removed and added back to the random pool.\n\nThe Bell Ritual must be accomplished here.\nRotary Phone Head will not hunt here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTR: 10 DEX: 10 CTRL: 10 HP: 3\nPunch (d4)\n\nChatty Irish groundskeeper\nCreates messes she gets others to clean up\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this mystery there are East and West locations.\nThe investigators will start by investigating the East locations. Once they have discovered all the East locations they will discover the Gilbury Bridge that leads to the West locations.\nThe exits of East locations cannot be used to move directly to West locations or vice versa.\nWhen investigators try to use an exit and there are no valid locations left in the pool, or the connection is invalid (i.e. an East location to a West location) they do not move normally. Instead, the Investigators move to a random valid location with an empty exit and they each suffer one stress. The 2 exits become connected.\n\n\n\nThe 10 east locations are included within the sticky pool at the start of this sticky crawl.\nThe focus of this mystery in on the investigator’s interactions with The Guillotined. Therefore, the descriptions of the locations are deliberately sparse. The facilitator is free to expand these in prep or during play.\nEast locations cannot directly connect to West locations. The East and West are only connected by Gilbury Bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smell of heather envelopes the area giving a homely vibe.\n\nThose that rest here heal 1 CTRL (max once). After the rest the investigator can no longer smell any and all heather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere there was once herbs, now poppies of red, purple, yellow, and white have conquered the land. The poppies move together as if they share the same dream.\n\nThose who haphazardly walk through will find themselves falling asleep (STR save to avoid sleep).\nIf there are no awake investigators to watch/help the investigator will have one of their items stolen by Rotary Phone Head if they are alive and have been activated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA large cluster of dark purple irises surrounded by irises of yellow, orange and red forms a perfectly circle garden.\n\nSlowly the irses will turn to follow the investigators.\nEach investigator will get the strong urge to deeply look at them. Those who do make a CTRL save.\n\nThose who failed will have their vision reversed. Their iris will look into their eye instead of outwards (1d4 dex damage).\nVision will mostly return to normal once they leave the iris garden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA large open space of grass with scatterings of trees. It is darker than the rest of the gardens as a pitch black sky hangs above with no sign of the moon or stars.\n\nFor those who watch the sky they will hear the sound of a bell come from space.\nIt will ring 7 times, each time a new star appears forming a constellation in the shape of a bell. Those who hear all seven rings suffer 1 stress.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApproaching the flower nursery they hear the sound of a screaming baby from its centre.\n\nThe source is a fox, all its fur replaced by red petals (1d4 stress).\nIt will run off screaming whilst leaving a trail of petals.\nIf followed it will be found being strangled by Rotary Phone Head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA grainy cacophony loudly plays from the 13th century Manor house. It only becomes louder and more disorienting within its maze like halls where the walls are covered with portraits of individuals each head replaced by a bell.\n\nGramophone Head can be found alone in a massive ballroom attempting to drink whiskey and smoke a cigar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lovely space for individuals with dementia to relax in the gardens.\n\nRotary Phone Head is waiting here, they will hide when investigators approach.\nFrom then on Rotary phone head is activated and will stalk the investigators, attempting to ambush one when they are alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA solemn location where cherry blossom petals slowly but constantly fall.\n\nAs each petal hits the ground it becomes a miniature petal origami human which goes through an entire life through the period of a minute.\nOnce the petal human dies it rises back up to the cherry tree as a seemingly normal petal only to go through the cycle once more.\nThe first petal taken by an investigator becomes frozen in time. It is now a memento with 1 stability. Further petals shrivel and lies still with all its potential taken.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA garden surrounded by large manicured yew hedges. Investigating and appreciating the griffin topped sundial is the friendly Typewriter Head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA once peaceful wood has become overgrown with thick razor sharp brambles. Walking the path to its side the sounds of crumbling trees can be heard from within.\n\nLone investigators will be ambushed by Rotary Phone Head, if alive, when they are alone here.\nInvestigators must roll a CTRL save or become separated from other investigators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all the Central locations have been entered at least once use the below location as the next location to add to the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stone walking bridge is guarded by a massive goat. Below it where a road once was is a deep fast flowing river that will devour any who try to cross it, the danger is immediately obvious.\n- The Massive goat (Massive Billy Goat Gruff) can surprisingly speak and will demand the toll of a rotary phone to pass.\n- The E exit can only lead to/from East locations.\n- The W exit can only lead to/from West locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTR: 14 DEX: 14 CTRL: 10 HP: 6\nRam (d8)\n\nA massive talking goat\nGuards a bridge requiring a toll to pass\nAlthough it will not let anyone pass without the toll it is surprisingly helpful\n\n\n\n\n\nThe train line goes through this area. The train is constantly on the move, only briefly stopping at central station. Only glimpses of the train can be seen through the steam its constantly blowing whistle emits.\nThe 10 west locations can only be accessed through the Gilbury Bridge location and other West locations. East locations cannot directly connect to West locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn intersection of 2 paths, a part of the gardens forgotten by visitors and staff alike.

Where once a gnarled and hollow tree stood now stands a massive yew treant.\n\nThe treant will talk and try to persuade people to come closer.\nIt is rooted in place but grabs anything moving within its reach, raising it to its mouth to eat.\nIt will not chew, instead only swallowing.\nSoon the unlucky morsel will fall out the bottom of the treant suffering d6 damage and the treant will be satisfied momentarily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTR: 16 DEX: 6 CTRL: 8 HP: 8 ARMOR: 2\nConsume (d6) Pummel (d8 + d8)\n\nA treant born from a 300 year old hollow yew tree\nActs friendly to try to entice people to come closer\nHas a terrible hunger it can never be rid of\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic washes through the area as CRT TV Head looks over the pond.

They respond in kind, with grunts, huffs, and whistles.\nAs they reach the tree, engulfed by its shadow, they view their prize. A heavy tarnished bell. It hangs from a branch by a heavy rusted chain. The six instinctively circle it and talk and talk. Their speech, full of jargon, overlaps and quickens into a cacophony, the meaning lost to their guide. She promptly leaves, surely nothing strange will happen again. But of course something will happen again, otherwise we wouldn’t be here. And so, as she reaches the entrance of the Oxbury gardens she hears a massive unearthly gong from the bell.
