Our success is just a ruse, For it’ll win with its black liquid.\nFor to enchant others the payment’s your mind, To be replaced with its inkened blots. So be content with your fate assigned, Decided upon by the taker of thoughts.\nWho wrote this poem? It’s in my hand. Did it come from my dome? I don’t understand.",

Now your trunk is rough like bark, Traced over with lichtenburg figures.\nAcross your skin branching like a tree, Disguised as an arboreal tattoo. You know it is a key, To a power that glows Electric blue.\nWhen it courses through you with voltage, It’ll bequeath you a mighty strength. Burning through your body in rage, To pay you’ll go to any length.\nA fallen tree with cracks aflame, Those it touches become like kings. Shining bright but ultimately put to shame, For it’ll burn within you, The Lighter of Kindling.",

    "text": "To start the mystery “Issy” brings the investigators to the “The Old Bell”. She will answer questions but remain at The Old Bell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn old metal bell hangs off a tree with a thick rusted chain. Below the bell are seven concentric rings like ripples in the dirt. 6 sets of footprint leading away from the bell scar the once perfect circles.\n\nRinging the bell causes 2 effects:\n\nThose who ring the bell suffer 1 stress per ring.\nThe ringer chooses a location (sticky note) without any investigators. This location is removed and added back to the random pool.\n\nThe Bell Ritual must be accomplished here.\nRotary Phone Head will not hunt here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this mystery there are East and West locations.\nThe investigators will start by investigating the East Locations. Once they have discovered all the East locations they will discover the Gilbury bridge that leads to the West locations.\nThe exits of East locations cannot be used to move directly to West locations. The exits of West locations cannot be used to move directly to East locations.\nWhen investigators try to use an exit and there are no valid locations left in the pool, or the connection is invalid (i.e. a East location to a West location) they do not move normally. Instead, the Investigators move to a random valid location with an empty exit and they each suffer one stress. The 2 exits become connected.\n\n\n\nThe 10 east locations are “A locations” and so are included within the sticky pool at the start of this sticky crawl.\nThe focus of this mystery in on the investigator’s interactions with The Guillotined. Therefore, the descriptions of the locations are deliberately sparse. The facilitator is free to expand these in prep or during play.\nEast locations cannot directly connect to West locations. The East and West are only connected by Gilbury bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe smell of heather envelopes the area giving a homely vibe.\n\nThose that rest here heal 1 lost CTRL (max once). After the rest the investigator can no longer smell heather.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe herbs have been taken over by red, purple, yellow, and white poppies.\n\nThose who haphazardly walk through will find themselves falling asleep (STR save to avoid sleep).\nIf there are no awake investigators to watch/help the investigator will have one of their items stolen by Rotary Phone Head if they are alive and have been activated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ground is covered in purple irises.\n\nSlowly they will turn to follow the investigators.\nEach investigator will get the strong urge to deeply look at them. Those who do make a CTRL save.\n\nThose who failed will have their vision reversed, where their iris looks into their eye instead of out of their eye (1d4 dex damage).\nTheir vision will mostly return to normal once they leave the iris garden.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA large open space with scatterings of trees. The normal stars and moon of the night sky are invisible, instead a pitch dark sky lays above.\n\nFor those who watch the sky they will hear the sound of a bell come from space.\nIt will ring 7 times, each time a new star appears forming a constellation in the shape of a bell (1 stress).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sound of a screaming baby can be heard coming from the centre of the flower nursery.\n\nThe source is a fox, all its fur replaced by red petals (1d4 stress).\nIt will run off screaming and leave a trail of petals.\nIf followed you will find it being strangled by Rotary Phone Head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sound of a cacophonous gramophone can be heard outside and through all the halls. The inside is a large maze-like 18th century house, walls covered with portraits of individuals each head replaced by a bell.\n\nGramophone Head can be found in one of the rooms attempting to drink whiskey and smoke a cigar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lovely space for individuals with dementia to relax in the gardens.\n\nRotary Phone Head is waiting here, they will hide when investigators approach.\nFrom then on Rotary phone head is activated and will stalk the investigators, attempting to ambush one when they are alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA solemn location where cherry blossoms petals slowly but constantly fall.\n\nAs the petal hits the ground a miniature petal origami human goes through an entire life through the period of a minute.\nOnce the petal human dies the petal rises back to the cherry tree to go through the cycle once more.\nThe first petal taken by an investigator becomes frozen in time becoming a memento with 1 stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA garden surrounded by large manicured yew hedges. Investigating and appreciating the griffin topped sundial is the friendly Typewriter Head.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wood has become overgrown with thick razor sharp brambles. Only the sounds of crumbling trees can be heard.\n\nLone investigator’s will be ambushed by Rotary Phone Head, if alive, when they are alone here.\nInvestigator’s must roll a CTRL save or become separated from other investigators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce all the Central locations have been entered at least once use the below location as the next location to add to the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA massive goat guards the bridge. Below it where the road once was is a deep fast flowing river that will devour any who try to cross it, the danger is immediately obvious.\n\nThe Massive goat can surprisingly speak and will demand the toll of a rotary phone to pass.\nThe E exit can only lead to/from East locations.\nThe W exit can only lead to/from West locations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe train line goes through this area. The train is constantly on the move, only briefly stopping at central station. Although only glimpses of the train can be seen in its steam whistle is constantly going off.\nThe 10 west locations are “C locations” and can only be accessed through the Gilbury bridge.\nThe W exit of the Gilbury bridge leads to the West locations.\nEast locations cannot directly connect to West locations. The East and West are only connected by Gilbury bridge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOff in the intersection of two paths Chalkboard head can be found.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA curling boardwalk over a dreaded bog. Whispers of dead loved ones will speak in decipherable noises.\n\nWhen traversing make a CTRL save.\n\nSuccess: Traverse the boardwalk and they teleport to their final destination within the gardens.\nFailure: d6 stress and go back to the start of Boardwalk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Bog Gardens are covered in a steam mist produced by Steam Whistle Head.\n\nIt is difficult to find Steam Whistle Head as their whistles echo in the mist and the poor visibility makes navigating the bog dangerous.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmongst the trees and plants stands out the Domesday yew. Where once a hollowed out tree stood now stands a massive yew treant.\n\nThe treant will talk and try to persuade people to come closer.\nIt is rooted in place but grabs anything moving within its reach, raising it to its mouth to eat.\nIt will not chew, instead only swallowing.\nSoon the unlucky morsel will fall out the bottom of the treant suffering d6 damage and the treant will be satisfied momentarily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic washes through the area as CRT TV Head looks over the pond. Moths buzz around their head as dragonflies fly in and out of the light hunting them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWeeping willows reflect off the mirror surface of the pond.\n\nThe branches of the trees sink into the water, they grab and attempt to drown the vain\n\nDEX save to avoid\nSTR save to pull friend from willow tree’s grasp or an inventive idea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 identical ponds lie at the end of a stream.\n\nEach pond reflects the image the other pond should.\nIf Rotary Phone Head is still on the loose he will be easily spotted lurking in the trees through these reflections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA collection of red leafed Nyssa surround this three way intersection.\n\nWhen entering the intersection a gale picks up and the leaves envelop the investigators.\nAfterwards, randomly determine which way the investigators leave.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rock garden full of life and rocks. In the centre stands an upright log with a golden bell.\n\nAs the investigators traverse the rock garden the rocks shift and grind the trees, plants and log down into the earth.\nThe investigators can retreat safely or attempt to grab the bell before it is swallowed by the rocks.\nTo grab the bell make a DEX save\n\nSuccess = Grab Golden bell (deals d6 stress to otherworld entities/monsters and the transformed (those with 3 or more fallouts))\nFailure = suffer d6 damage.\n\nIf the investigators return to this location it looks like it once did before the destruction and will remain stable, but their will be no bell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA small train station for a small steam train. When the foot wide train arrives it spits out steam and screams a whistle of pain.\n\nWhilst driving the train, the investigator can make it stop at any West location. The train restarts once investigators have jumped off.\nJumping onto the train is dangerous due to the scalding hot steam surrounding it (d6 damage).",

As she leads them she talks away her nerves. The six only look ahead hearing her words not with meaning but as senseless noise. Nevertheless she continues to create sounds. They respond in kind, with grunts, huffs, and whistles.\nAs they reach the tree, engulfed by its shadow, they see their prize. A heavy tarnished bell hangs off a branch with a chain. The six instinctively circle it and talk and talk. Their speech, full of jargon, overlaps and quickens into a cacophony, the meaning lost to their guide. She promptly leaves, surely nothing strange will happen again. But of course something will happen again, otherwise we wouldn’t be here. And so, as she reaches the entrance of the Oxbury gardens she hears a massive unearthly gong from the bell. She brings out her phone and rings a friend, hopefully her meaning won’t be lost through the panic in her voice.",
