The groundskeeper, Issy (she/her) (Issabella), has recruited the investigators to help. She let six individuals enter the gardens after dark. They came to study the old bell, but something went wrong.\nAfter leaving the six, Issy heard an immense ringing that rattled her soul. She found no one at the bell and she has an itch at her neck she can’t get rid of. Not wanting to phone the cops because she shouldn’t let people in after dark, especially for money she pockets herself, she contacts one of the investigators she knows.\nOnce the investigators have arrived at the Old Bell they wil not be able to escape the gardens until they have completed The Bell Ritual. To complete the ritual they must find The Guillotined and help them communicate to acquire the ritual steps.\n\n\nThe sections of this mystery are:\n\nPrelude: Narration prelude to set the scene.\nConnections: Information on Issy and the humans The Guillotined used to be so the investigators can have connections to them.\nThe Bell ritual: The ritual the investigators must perform to escape the garden.\nThe Guillotined: The six changed individuals.

    "text": "The Sticky Crawl is a method to create mystery/adventure locations with the following features:\n\nLocations are represented by sticky notes with 1-4 exits (matching the sticky note sides).\nThe layout of the locations is organic with random sticky notes being placed as the investigators use exits.\nThe locations of each investigator is tracked by a token (e.g. dice, meeples, coins etc.). NPCs and monsters can also be tracked by tokens. Tokens are used to show which location an entity (investigator/NPC/monster) is in but not necessarily where in the location they are.\nEach location is not randomly made, instead the “pool” of locations are bespoke to the mystery.\n\nThe Sticky crawl has been designed for Liminal horror as it ties well to horrorific and liminal spaces. Of course it can be adapted and used for any system.\n\n\nWhy run or create a Sticky crawl instead of other methods?\nReasons include:\n\nSticky crawls are quick and interactive for the Facilitator and Players.\n\nFacilitators do not need to print out a map. Instead, they draw each location on a sticky note as each location appears.\nPlayers decide which exits to use and not to use, partially determining how the locations spread out.\n\nUsing ephemeral sticky notes intentionally encourages an art style that is easy and quick to imitate.\n\nAs someone who’s technical art skills are low it is nice to be able to make lo-fi images with purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is a brief summary of how to carry out a Sticky Crawl as the Facilitator.\n\n\nOnce the investigators have entered the area set down the first location. This may be a specific starting location or randomly chosen from the initial pool of locations.\nBelow the facilitator has started with the entrance of the museum the mystery will take place in. There are 3 exits to other locations, the lines on the left, top, and right of the sticky note. Tokens are placed in the location for the three investigators; Adam, Axel, and Blaze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a group of investigators moves through an exit a location from a valid pool is added. Generally a new location is decided by rolling a dice matching the maximum number of locations in the pool.\nWhen placing a new location:\n\nEnsure the new location connects to the previous location via an exit.\nOrient the location to keep as many exits of the new location unblocked as possible.\n\nWhen randonly determining a location, if the location is not available:\n\nChoose the next available location in descending order (e.g 6 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1).\nIf there are none available with a lower number choose the next in ascending order.\nIf there are no locations available the investigators cannot use the exit.\n\nBelow, Adam and Axel use the exit on the left. The facilitator has a pool of 6 locations (not including the entrance) so they roll a D6 to randomly decide which location they move to.\nD6 locations:\n\nPrecambrian\nDinosaurs\nNeolithic\nBronze age\nIron age\nIndustrial\n\nThey rolled a 2 giving them the Dinosaurs exhibit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the same time Blaze decided to take the top exit.

It is near the start of the mystery so the faciltator agrees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor one last example, Axel decides to use the top exit in the Dinosaurs exhibit.

The locations include:\n\nThe starting location, Entrance.\nThe 6 main exhibits that were in the inital pool (Dinosaurs, Precambrian, Neolithic, Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Industrial).\nThe Security room, discovered by finding the security key and using them on a free exit.\nThe Big Bang exhibit which was added to the pool of available rooms after discovering the 6 main exhibits.\n\nThe locations each investigator can move into with one movement are:\n\nAdam: The Big Bang exhibit and the Precambrian exhibit.\nAxel: The Entrance and the Bronze Age exhibit.\nBlaze: The Brinze Age exhibit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArea: This is the entire area of the mystery and is composed of all the locations.\nLocation: A location is one sticky note representing a location separate from other locations.

This allow investigators to travel between locations. When travelling between two locations the locations must be touching each other’s sides and both the sides must have an exit. The cinnection between two locations can be a door, a path, a road, etc.\nPool: A pool of locations is a set of locations that can be randomly drawn from.

Now your trunk is rough like bark, Traced over with lichtenburg figures.\nAcross your skin branching like a tree, Disguised as an arboreal tattoo. You know it is a key, To a power that glows Electric blue.\nWhen it courses through you with voltage, It’ll bequeath you a mighty strength. Burning through your body in rage, To pay you’ll go to any length.\nA fallen tree with cracks aflame, Those it touches become like kings.

All humans in the gardens (the investigators and Issy) can hear this and suffer stress. The first ring is 1 stress and the next are +1 stress of the previous ring (1, 2, 3, 4, etc.).\n\n\n\nTo start the mystery Issy brings the investigators to the “The Old Bell” location. She will answer questions but remain at The Old Bell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn old metal bell hangs off a tree with a thick rusted chain. Below the bell are seven concentric rings like ripples in the dirt. 6 sets of footprint leading away from the bell scar the once perfect circles.\n\nThe bell is a striking bell, it has no clapper and must be struck with an external instrument. Stirking it lets out a reverberating gong.\nStriking the bell causes 2 effects:\n\nThose who strike the bell suffer 1 stress per ring.\nThe striker chooses a location (sticky note) without any investigators (if any). This location is removed and added back to the random pool.\n\nThe Bell Ritual must be accomplished here.\nRotary Phone Head will not hunt here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTR: 10 DEX: 10 CTRL: 10 HP: 3\nPunch (d4)\n\nA chatty Irish groundskeeper\nShe creates messes she gets others to clean up\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this mystery there are East and West locations.\nThe investigators will start by investigating the East locations. Once they have discovered all the East locations they will discover the Gilbury Bridge that leads to the West locations.\nThe exits of East locations cannot be used to move directly to West locations or vice versa.\nWhen investigators try to use an exit and there are no valid locations left in the pool, or the connection is invalid (i.e. an East locations to a West locations) they do not move normally. Instead, the Investigators move to a random valid location with an empty exit and they each suffer one stress. The 2 exits become connected.\n\n\n\nThe 10 east locations are included within the sticky pool at the start of this sticky crawl.\nThe focus of this mystery in on the investigator’s interactions with The Guillotined. Therefore, the descriptions of the locations are deliberately sparse. The facilitator is free to expand these in prep or during play.\nEast locations cannot directly connect to West locations.

In the centre stands an upright log with a golden bell.\n\nAs the investigators traverse the rock garden the rocks shift and grind the trees, plants and log down into the earth.\nThe investigators can retreat safely or attempt to grab the bell before it is swallowed by the rocks.\nExample: To grab the bell make a DEX save\n\nSuccess = Grab Golden bell (deals d6 stress to otherworld entities/monsters and the transformed, those with 3 or more fallouts)\nFailure = suffer d6 damage.\n\nIf the investigators return to this location it looks like it once did before the destruction and will remain stable, but their will be no bell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA small train station for a small steam train. When the foot wide train arrives it spits out steam and screams a whistle of pain.\n\nWhilst driving the train, the investigator can make it stop at any West location. The train restarts once investigators have jumped off.\nJumping onto the train from other locations is dangerous due to the scalding hot steam surrounding it.",

As she leads them she talks away her nerves. The six look ahead hearing her words not with meaning but as senseless noise. Nevertheless she continues to create sounds. They respond in kind, with grunts, huffs, and whistles.\nAs they reach the tree, engulfed by its shadow, they view their prize. A heavy tarnished bell. It hangs from a branch by a heavy rusted chain. The six instinctively circle it and talk and talk. Their speech, full of jargon, overlaps and quickens into a cacophony, the meaning lost to their guide. She promptly leaves, surely nothing strange will happen again. But of course something will happen again, otherwise we wouldn’t be here. And so, as she reaches the entrance of the Oxbury gardens she hears a massive unearthly gong from the bell. She brings out her phone and rings a friend, hopefully her meaning won’t be lost through the panic in her voice.",
