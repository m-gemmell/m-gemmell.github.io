## Dilemma

Team chooses one of 2 options:

- Hired by Gaians to stop the assassination attempts during the wedding.
- Hired by [Camera Obscura](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd) to assassinate the 2 brides. Camera Obscura agents are known as shutterbugs.

Two very rich and influential brides are to marry at a very opulent wedding. One is an [ELDER DOTTER OF TARTARUS](/Tartarus/Followers.qmd#elder_dotter) called Ruby and one is a [PROTEAN CAPTAIN](/Proteus/Followers.qmd#protean_captain) called River.

The wedding takes place at a extravagant estate built by the [Ruby River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_River) in southwestern Montana.

## Preventing assasination

FIST must stop the Camera Obscura shutterbugs.
The players will be told by the Gaians when the assassinations will occur but have no further intel.
The players can gather intel and should try to figure out who the shutterbugs are and their mode of assassination before the events.

However, they will be informed to not capture or stop the shutterbugs until each of their scheduled events.
Otherwise an unknown less cautious backup shutterbug ([NYXMERA DARK TROPPER](/Nyxmera/Troops.qmd#nyxmera_dark_tropper)) will appear in their place.

## Carrying out assassination

The player team will get the chance to kill the brides in their nuptial bedroom. They must do this before they have started consummation of their marriage.

However, they will also need to stop the 2 assassination attempts at the ceremony and dinner. Due to the Camera Obscura rules they cannot harm, kill, or kidnap the other "shutterbugs".

The Camera Obscura client wants the assassination to occur at 1 of three times.
They will not pay if it occurs outside of these times.

## Assassination events

### Rehearsal dinner

No assassination but a prime time for the players to carry out some intel gathering on the hired shutterbugs.

### Ceremony

Kill them before they both put on their rings.

[THE KING](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_king) is using one of their personaes (Aurelia Blaine) to attend the wedding as an invited guest.
They will steal River's wedding ring and attempt to set their curse during the rehearsal dinner whilst they are entertaining and performing card tricks for the brides.

Clue: Players will overhear one of the bridesmaids saying they have lost River's ring as they recruit help from the other bridesmaids.

If not stopped River and Ruby will turn into gold as Ruby puts River's ring on.

### Dinner

Kill them during the dinner. The dinner takes place in a large ball room with dining tables, a dance floor, and a stage with various bands and performances throughout the evening.
The dinner will consists of the speeches followed by the main meal.
This will be followed by cutting and eating of the cake which is followed by the first dance of the brides.

The designated shutterbug is [THE ANTIDOTER](/Nyxmera/Camera_Obscura.qmd#the_antidoter). 
They have poisoned all the food with the first part of their poison and the entire wedding cake with the second part.
They will die during their first dance.
During the dinner the 2 brides will leave and a fog machine will go off before the dancing commences. This is the work of the antidoter and can act as a clue to what is going on.

### Nuptials

Kill them in their nuptials bedroom before the wedding is consummated.

Ignore the below shutterbugs if the players are carrying out the assassination.
Team of assassins breach into guarded VIP building.
