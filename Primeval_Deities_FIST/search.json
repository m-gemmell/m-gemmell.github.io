    "text": "A cult who worship the great worm Skyuss. They wish to feed the snow worms by any means.\nSnow worms normally attack other prey than humans but aurora’s attract and enrage them. The cult uses this to cause night time attacks where they would like through auro generators.\n\n\nIncubator cultist of Skyuss\n(3 HP, Choke 5: see incubation trait)\n\nKnife (worst of 2D6 damage)\nWrapped up in fur clothing\nPurple eggs visibly jutting out from their skin.\n\nINCUBATION: These cultists are so devout to the rising of Skyuss they have grafted snow worms eggs onto their skin. When they are killed they release 1 Premature Snow worm swarm. If they choke they will release 2, the cultist dying in the process.\n\n\n\nMutated cultist of Skyuss\n(3 HP)\n\nM1 Thompson submachine gun (1D6 damage)\nLarge circular maw of diamond teeth for crush (1D6 + 1 damage)\nPiercing crazed purple eyes\nSparse diamond plating on purple skin (1 ARMOR)\nCryophobic, takes damage from the cold.\n\nDIAMOND-BONED: These cultists ingested snow worm eggs to gain their power. These mutations led to their bones becoming replaced by smaller interlocking diamond bones. These mutants can fit through incredibly tight passages and holes allowing them to escape and hide effectively.\n\n\n\nDeacon of Skyuss\n(6 HP, 2 armour)\n\nAurora gun (1D6+2 damage, STUN)\nA holy figure covered in purple robes\nPurple eyes are the only sign of Snow worm influence on her body\n\nWORM-FIDDLER: Deacons want to cultivate the worms to adulthood before unleashing them upon the towns, then cities, then the world. However, once at least 10 cultists have been killed they will activate their Aurora generator tower in a desperate attempt to stop FIST.\nSTUN weapon tag: Those damaged by this weapon cannot move or act until their current HP changes.\n\nAurora generator\n(20 HP, 2 armour)\nThis large device produces an artificial Aurora to attract Snow Worms. This can be focussed anywhere within a 5 mile radius of the generator at night. Whilst activated will attract 1 Juvenile Snow Worm every 5 minutes. It can even attract larger snow worms if present.\nThe device also sends out an ultrasonic frequency that deters snow worms from getting within 20 feet of the generator. Deactivation codes are held by the presiding Deacon of Skyuss.\n\n\n\n\nPremature Snow Worm swarm\n(3 HP)\n\nBite (1D6-2 damage, min 1)\n2 foot purple worms with Leach-like mouths.\nCryophobic, takes damage from the cold\nWill attack all humans indiscriminately\n\nLEACH: These purple worms are like half a metre long with leach like mouths. They are soft lacking the diamond rods and teeth of their older forms. When the swarm bites someone they attach and leach blood and heat from the victim, wrapping around appendages. They will attack other snow worms on the same host. Will deal 1 damage every day if not removed.\n\n\n\nJuvenile Snow Worm\n(6 HP)\n\nLarge circular maw of diamond teeth for crushing (1D6 + 1 damage)\n10 foot purple snow worm\nCovered in diamond rods and purple scales (1 ARMOR)\nRods also act as sensory organ picking up vibrations\nCryophobic, takes damage from the cold\nAurora-philic, Attracted and enraged by the Aurora lights\nWill attack all humans indiscriminately\nDeathly territorial, only permitting one other snow worm\n\nTUNNELLER: The snow worm keeps warm in cold climes by efficiently digging through snow, dirt, and rocks. If damaged for 3 or more damage it will escape into the ground only to re-emerge and attack from a different direction.\n\n\n\nAdult Snow Worm\n(15 HP)\n\nLarge circular maw of diamond teeth for crushing (1D6 + 2 damage)\n100 foot purple snow worm\nCovered in thick diamond rods and purple scales (2 ARMOR)\nRods also act as sensory organ picking up vibrations\nCryophobic, takes damage from the cold\nAurora-philic, Attracted and enraged by the Aurora lights\nUsually hunts larger game than humans\nDeathly territorial, only permitting one other snow adult worm\nCan reproduce sexually and asexually, laying eggs it does not care for\n\nDIAMOND-DRILL: The Snow Worm can naturally grow diamonds. It quickly drills through snow, ice, ground, and rocks. It is fast enough to keep up with a car whilst drilling but slow on top of ground.\nSCRAPE (BOSS MOVE): The Adult Snow Worm can scrape its diamond rods against multiple enemies dealing 1D6 DAMAGE to each.\n\n\n\nUltrasonic harmonic frequency grenade\n(Consumable item)\nThis grenade sends out an adjustable ultrasonic frequency. It can be set to a frequency that will destroy the diamond rods of Snow worms if the users knows the frequency. This will decrease the snow worm’s armour by 1 and deal 1D6 damage.\nThe grenade can be used on other solid objects, bye bye bones!\nIt contains a reusable harmonic frequency detector (as long as grenade has not been used). Requires touching the grenade to the object tested."

And on the other a call of action for everyone else to join the environmental fight.\nSome members form more radical groups that sabotage environmentally damaging facilities such as oil pipes, chemical production companies, etc.\n\nTAG Protestor\n(3 HP, CHOKE 5: Scatter and hide)\n\nPlacard & leaflets\nUnassuming clothing with a cap\nSnacks and drinks\nLoud and proud\n\nCONVICTED: Many protesters have been previously imprisoned for their convictions. They can be majorly disruptive but people will only deal with them if given orders they can’t refuse. A touch from a group of protesters will cause most to join the protest. Many that join this way leave with a very foggy memory of it all.\n\n\n\nTAG Eco Fighter\n(4 HP, 1D6 appear)\n\nWinchester Model 1200 Pump-action shotgun (1D6+1 DAMAGE)\nMolotov cocktail (1D6 DAMAGE, one use)\nHunting apparel with backpack\nBinoculars\nNormal men and women who look like hunters\nSigns of damage by industrial exploitation\n\nJUSTIFIED: Eco warriors stand up for what is right. They have been harmed by industrial chemicals or machines. With nothing left they will put down their lives to ensure life will continue.

A game this hacker now knows how to play. Incredible skills in hacking computers, phone lines, and social situations make them perfect agents for TAG. However, they must be kept on a short leash as they don’t hack for what is right but rather because they have been wronged. Hackers will quickly changed side if given enough incentives in finances, safety, and comfortability.\nELECTRIFIED weapon tag: Deals double DAMAGE to robots and other complex machines. Shorts out running electronics and briefly electrifies bodies of water.\nFloppy disk wallet item: Contains 5 floppy disks. Each disk is consumed when used to try to hack a computer system with a floppy disk input. Each disk has a single word indicating its effect; Ransom ware, Decrypt, Virus, Login, and Loop. The effect of each floppy disk is detremined by the circumstance, imagination of the players, result of relvant action roll, and the referee’s decision.\n\n\n\nTAG Leader\n(6 HP)\n\nSteyr AUG assault rifle (1D6+1 DAMAGE)\nBlade of grass, sword (2D6 DAMAGE, RITUAL)\nTactical vest (1 ARMOR)\nEnchanted wood shield (2 ARMOR, equip as weapon)\nBlowing horn, calls forth the largest nearby land animals (1 use)\nLong flowing hair framing a beautiful face\nGentle but commanding voice\n\nTAMER: Able to keep TAG fighters in line this leader is vital to TAG violent activities. They can tame and enlarge multiple wild creatures of the same species with the blessing of Gaia. If the TAG Leader is killed or knocked unconscious the effect will immediately end.\nRITUAL weapon tag: Shatters to protect you from death once, negating lethal damage. Disintegrates afterward."

The outpost is surrounded by a barbed wire topped fence with gate. Its insides and outside are littered with detritus and garbage. There is little else so the cult can make the place look abandoned.\nInside is a buzz of activity and kept very hot with many radiators. A garage is connected to the main building which contains a large SUV (8 HP, 1 ARMOR).\n\nLower floor\nThe lower floor contains 6 rooms with one hallway touching the inner walls.

They will shoot allies and enemies alike with their laser rifles. When dealing damage with these they harm the target on even totals and heal the target on odd totals. Normally the referee will choose which die to use. However, if a player adds one or more WAR DICE they choose which single dice to remove from the DAMAGE.\n\n\nNyxmera Light Trooper\n(3 HP, 1D6 appear)\n\nLaser shotgun (1D6 + 1 DAMAGE)\n1D6 stun grenades (temporary blinding, one use)\nHelmet mounted lantern (close range sight in the dark)\nMeteor metal armor (2 ARMOR)\nHard light projector (1 use)\n\nSTEADFAST: These heavy troopers stand strong against the dark. They routinely use the combination of their lanterns and hard light projectors to corner enemies.\nHardlight wall generator weapon: A heavy 2 handed device that can create a 2 ARMOR 5 foot tall by 10 foot wide hard light wall projection 10 feet in front of the device. It must be continuously fired whilst the user is illuminated. Due to the weight of the hard light the wall must be kept on the ground for normal humans. The hard light is frictionless and so can be moved slowly by the user.\n\n\nNyxmera Dark Trooper\n(6 HP)\n\nMeteor sword (1D6 + 1 DAMAGE, LIGHT)\nNight vision goggles (see at night)\nLight diffraction weave bodysuit (1 ARMOR, difficult to see)\nShadow boots (Can teleport from one shadow to another within a range of 30 feet, 1 use)\nDeployable hard light hoverboard (accessory)\n\nPATIENT: The dark trooper will watch and stalk enemies. It will bide its time for the best opportunity to reveal itself based on how cool it would be. If it begins a fight with no backup it will take no DAMAGE from the first attack against them, doing a narly flip or trick to evade it."
