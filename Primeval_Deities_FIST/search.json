After a rapid pillage they scarper off leaving any wounded behind. They never abduct living things. The literal definition of scrappy, they like to bicker between themselves over loot. Tartarus raiders are good drivers and only use their thundersticks on pursuing vehicles, not wanting to destroy any possible loot.\n\n\n\nTartarus fire warriors (6 HP)\n\nFlame thrower (1D6 + 1 DAMAGE, INCENDIARY)\nNapalm grenade (1D6 + 2 DAMAGE, 1 use)\nPyrogen fire suppression grenade.

They have little self preservation thinking their suits will prevent any dangerous burns. They are fiercely defensive of their allies and will attract aggro. Whilst a Tartarus fire warrior is alive and in combat, attacks to non Taratarus fire warriors have -1 DAMAGE.\n\n\n\nTartarus magnetic slinger (4 HP)\n\nLong range gauss rifle, requires a bright and loud charge up time (1D6 + 2 DAMAGE, ARMOR PIERCING)\nTripwire grenade (1D6 + 1 DAMAGE, 1 use)\nSmoke grenade (1 use)\nFlare gun (3 uses)\nGhillie suit\nSluggish and cramped legs.\n\nVOLCANIC: Like a volcano this slinger is patient and difficult to detect whilst dormant. However their weapon provides an obvious signal to their target a few seconds before they can fire. Will use their flare gun to call for backup or attract prey.\n\n\n\nScrapper\nTO BUILD: A mechanic who takes care of the cars and builds weapons with scraps. Can attack with their wrench and make various scrap based items during combat."

    "text": "Golems of Tartarus are made from the bounties of Tartarus. They generally consist of local resources.\n\nMetal ore golem (11 HP)\n\nHeavy machine gun (1D6+2 DAMAGE, UNSTABLE)\nWarhammer (1D6+2 DAMAGE)\nOre body (2 ARMOR)\nMostly stationary and slow to react\nA crude approximation of a human in iron ore form.\n\nTOWER: It is a crude approximation of a human form made of dirt and local ores. Instead of legs, its body is a great pillar that can slowly shuffle over the ground. Although slow in movement they compensate with their unrelenting fire. If its enemies take cover it will slowly approach and destroy the cover with its warhammer dealing 2 DAMAGE from shrapnel to those behind it.\n\n\nObsidian lava golem (6 HP)\n\nObsidian arm blades (1D6+2 DAMAGE)\nObsidian lava spear (2D6 DAMAGE, golem takes one damage when used, 1 use)\nObsidian scales (1 ARMOR)\n\nGLASSBLOWER: The true form of this golem is formless lava. The golem can change any lava that is part of it or touches it to obsidian of any shape. With this ability it creates an obsidian based skeleton, armor, and weapons. Additionally, it can change obsidian back into lava.\n\n\nLithium golems (3 HP, 2D6 appear)\n\nExplosive spit (1D6 DAMAGE)\n\nCASCADE: These blobs of lithium like to hide in crevasses and behind rocks. They will wait till their prey are surrounded by them before attacking. When they die they explode for 3 DAMAGE, this may cause a cascade of explosions from all the Lithium golems. Many cave-ins have been known to occur due to this.\n\n\nRadioactive gem golems (9 HP)\n\nPlasma rifle (2D6 DAMAGE, NUCLEAR-POWERED)\nPower armor (2 ARMOR, NUCLEAR-POWERED)\nQuartz, amethyst, violet fluorite, blue salt, yellow sapphires or green diamond core.\n\nPROJECTION: A radioactive projection produced from a single gem at their core. Although the most human looking of all the golems they are also the most terrifying. They give off constant nuclear radiation which they use to power their weapons and armor. Anyone within melee range gets -2 to action rolls and loses 1HP per action.\nGEM: Their real body is their gem which has 3HP. If this is not destroyed the golem will reform in 1D6 days. Its gear is not part of its projection."

And on the other a call of action for everyone else to join the environmental fight.\nSome members form more radical groups that sabotage environmentally damaging facilities such as oil pipes, chemical production companies, etc.\n\nTAG Protestor (3 HP, CHOKE 5: Scatter and hide)\n\nPlacard & leaflets\nUnassuming clothing with a cap\nSnacks and drinks\nLoud and proud\n\nCONVICTED: Many protesters have been previously imprisoned for their convictions. They can be majorly disruptive but people will only deal with them if given orders they can’t refuse. A touch from a group of protesters will cause most to join the protest. Many that join this way leave with a very foggy memory of it all.\n\n\n\nTAG Eco Warrior (4 HP, 1D6 appear)\n\nWinchester Model 1200 Pump-action shotgun (1D6+1 DAMAGE)\nMolotov cocktail (1D6 DAMAGE, one use)\nHunting apparel with backpack\nBinoculars\nNormal men and women with some sign of damage by industrial exploitation\n\nJUSTIFIED: Eco warriors stand up for what is right. They have been harmed by industrial chemicals or machines. With nothing left they will put down their lives to ensure life will continue.
