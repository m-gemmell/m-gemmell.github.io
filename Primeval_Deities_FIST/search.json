Primarily they carry out peaceful protests and other activities that benefit the environment.\nTheir slogan is “you’re it” . ON one hand referring to those they are targeting or will target next. And on the other a call of action for everyone else to join the environmental fight.\nSome members form more radical groups that sabotage environmentally damaging facilities such as oil pipes, chemical production companies, etc.\n\nTAG Protestor\n(3 HP, CHOKE 5: Scatter and hide)\n\nPlacard & leaflets\nUnassuming clothing with a cap\nSnacks and drinks\nLoud and proud\n\nCONVICTED: Many protesters have been previously imprisoned for their convictions. They can be majorly disruptive but people will only deal with them if given orders they can’t refuse. A touch from a group of protesters will cause most to join the protest. Many that join this way leave with a very foggy memory of it all.\n\n\n\nTAG Eco Fighter\n(4 HP, 1D6 appear)\n\nWinchester Model 1200 Pump-action shotgun (1D6+1 DAMAGE)\nMolotov cocktail (1D6 DAMAGE, one use)\nHunting apparel with backpack\nBinoculars\nNormal men and women who look like hunters\nSigns of damage by industrial exploitation\n\nJUSTIFIED: Eco warriors stand up for what is right. They have been harmed by industrial chemicals or machines. With nothing left they will put down their lives to ensure life will continue. They will never surrender, either fighting till the end or retreating to fight another day. Intimidation tactics never work of eco warriors.\n\n\n\nTAG Hacker\n(5 HP)\n\nPB silenced pistol (1D6 DAMAGE)\nHacker’s axe (1D6+1 DAMAGE, ELECTRIFIED)\nConcealed bullet resistant vest (1 ARMOR)\nHard helmet (accessory)\nFloppy disk wallet (5 uses)\nPhreak whistle\nMobile phone and voice changer\nLumberjack attire\n\nHACKED-OFF: Society is all a farce! A game this hacker now knows how to play. Incredible skills in hacking computers, phone lines, and social situations make them perfect agents for TAG. However, they must be kept on a short leash as they don’t hack for what is right but rather because they have been wronged. Hackers will quickly changed side if given enough incentives in finances, safety, and comfortability.\nELECTRIFIED weapon tag: Deals double DAMAGE to robots and other complex machines. Shorts out running electronics and briefly electrifies bodies of water.\nFloppy disk wallet item: Contains 5 floppy disks. Each disk is consumed when used to try to hack a computer system with a floppy disk input. Each disk has a single word indicating its effect; Ransom ware, Decrypt, Virus, Login, and Loop. The effect of each floppy disk is detremined by the circumstance, imagination of the players, result of relvant action roll, and the referee’s decision.\n\n\n\nTAG Leader\n(6 HP)\n\nSteyr AUG assault rifle (1D6+1 DAMAGE)\nBlade of grass, sword (2D6 DAMAGE, RITUAL)\nTactical vest (1 ARMOR)\nEnchanted wood shield (2 ARMOR, equip as weapon)\nBlowing horn, calls forth the largest nearby land animals (1 use)\nLong flowing hair framing a beautiful face\nGentle but commanding voice\n\nTAMER: Able to keep TAG fighters in line this leader is vital to TAG violent activities. They can tame and enlarge multiple wild creatures of the same species with the blessing of Gaia. If the TAG Leader is killed or knocked unconscious the effect will immediately end.\nRITUAL weapon tag: Shatters to protect you from death once, negating lethal damage. Disintegrates afterward."

    "text": "Taloes (singula talos) of Tartarus are made from the bounties of Tartarus. They generally consist of local resources.\n\nMetal Ore Talos (11 HP)\n\nHeavy machine gun (1D6+2 DAMAGE, UNSTABLE)\nWarhammer (1D6+2 DAMAGE)\nOre body (2 ARMOR)\nMostly stationary and slow to react\nA crude approximation of a human in iron ore form.\n\nTOWER: It is a crude approximation of a human form made of dirt and local ores. Instead of legs, its body is a great pillar that can slowly shuffle over the ground. Although slow in movement they compensate with their unrelenting fire. If its enemies take cover it will slowly approach and destroy the cover with its warhammer dealing 2 DAMAGE from shrapnel to those behind it.\n\n\n\nObsidian Lava Talos (6 HP)\n\nObsidian arm blades (1D6+2 DAMAGE)\nObsidian lava spear (2D6 DAMAGE, talos takes one damage when used, 1 use)\nObsidian scales (1 ARMOR)\n\nGLASSBLOWER: The true form of this talos is formless lava. The talos can change any lava that is part of it or touches it to obsidian of any shape. With this ability it creates an obsidian based skeleton, armor, and weapons. Additionally, it can change obsidian back into lava.\n\n\n\nLithium Talos (3 HP, 2D6 appear)\n\nExplosive spit (1D6 DAMAGE)\n\nCASCADE: These blobs of lithium like to hide in crevasses and behind rocks. They will wait till their prey are surrounded by them before attacking. When they die they explode for 3 DAMAGE, this may cause a cascade of explosions from all the Lithium taloes. Many cave-ins have been known to occur due to this.\n\n\n\nRadioactive Gem Talos (9 HP)\n\nPlasma rifle (2D6 DAMAGE, NUCLEAR-POWERED)\nPower armor (2 ARMOR, NUCLEAR-POWERED)\nQuartz, amethyst, violet fluorite, blue salt, yellow sapphires or green diamond core.\n\nPROJECTION: A radioactive projection produced from a single gem at their core. Although the most human looking of all the taloes they are also the most terrifying. They give off constant nuclear radiation which they use to power their weapons and armor. Anyone within melee range gets -2 to action rolls and loses 1HP per action.\nGEM: Their real body is their gem which has 3HP. If this is not destroyed the talos will reform in 1D6 days. Its gear is not part of its projection."

    "text": "Tartarus is the ground we live on, they are the rocks, dirt, metal, and oil. Tartarus was once free with explosive energy but now lays dormant, encaged by the sky, trapped by Nyxmera. Tartarus loathes Nyxmera and Nyxmera’s apathy towards Tartarus fuels its bottled rage further.\nThe greatest presence of Tartarus is felt underground where Nyxmera cannot see with its eyes. Here you may find a deep black hole that leads to the DOT. The DOT is the Domain Of Taratarus. Time and space are inconsistent in the DOT. You may enter and subsequently leave in the past, present or future no matter how long you were in the DOT. Many monsters live in the DOT. Think Journey to the Center of the Earth, Narnia, the Fey Wild, The underdark etc.\nWorld governments have used the DOT as a dumping ground for garbage, scientific waste, and nuclear waste. This has lead to mutated humans and creatures due to the combination of radiation, chemicals, and the magic of the DOT. They mostly stay contained in the DOT but occasionally cause havoc on the surface.\n\nThe imprisoned deity of the earth.\nA seemingly calm surface with extreme power under the surface\nFollowers: Dotters of Tartarus\n\nFollowers include: Enslaved, prisoners, fighters, miners, oil workers, seismologists, & spelunkers\n\nGood activities\n\nFreeing the enslaved\nFight for justice\n\nEvil activities\n\nRaiding the surface\nRuthless capitalism\nDestruction of ecology\nPrison breaks\n\nBest followers\n\nRaider leader and Kraken higher ups who free modern day slaves and carry out prison breaks."
