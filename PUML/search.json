There is little about the theory of play or best practices. I recommend reading FIST ULTRA EDITION for more theory.\nThis rule set is built with my setting in mind. This is an alternative 1980s Earth where the Primeval deities influence its inhabitants. Most worship these deities and the world is divided into 6 superpowers and the Moon. The setting can be found at my Primeval Deities itch.io or website. It contains:\nUltimately how you use this RPG is up to you. You can use it along with its setting.

You should encourage the imagination of the player whilst informing them of your setting and its tone. The Player should in turn create characters that fit into yoursetting and allow you the freedom to create character stat blocks you would enjoy running.\nAllies can be used during down time to create narrative moments with your player’s PCs. It is the responsibility of the players to call in their Allies during missions.\nA Nemesis arrives into the action due to the Nemesis dice when a player calls for Ally assistance. However, this does not limit the use of Nemeses. I encourage you to incorporate Nemeses into your campaign. Allow a Nemesis to be the big bad of a campaign. Maybe the Nemeses of the players all work for one evil organisation. The Nemesis does not need to directly interfere in a mission, they could send henchmen, provide weapons to the mission enemies, or hack the PCs’ Equipment. Don’t be afraid to have cutaway scenes showing a Nemesis in their lair mistreating their minions, spouting evil monologues, or scheming with other Nemeses. Use the Nemeses as you see fit incorporating suggestions from the players.\n\nIf this seems like a lot then take things slow. I like to run a few adventures and see how the characters develop. Then as inspiration hits I incorporate the PCs, Allies, and Nemeses into the campaign plans. Of course try to create loose plans to allow the players’ actions to change it."
