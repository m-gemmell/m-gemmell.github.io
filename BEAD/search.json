    "text": "OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES\n\n\n\nTaloes (singular = talos) of Tartarus are animated beings made from the bounties of Tartarus. They generally consist of local resources.\nOBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES are sentient beings made of lava and obsidian.\nThey are each born from different hydrothermal vents. They use their birth vent to grow and breed the most beautiful collection of ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS.\nTo maintain life in THE GARDEN the TALOES stimmy the flow of lava by slightly blocking them with obsidian. It is a fine balance so pressure does not build up and cause an explosive eruption.\nIf the ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS of a TALOS is not well fed the TALOS will hunt JUVENILE OCTONUT CRABS as a source of nutrition.\n\nOBSIDIAN LAVA TALOS\n6HP | 1 ARMOR | TAC:-1 | FRC:+1 | RFX:+1 | CRE:-1\n\nObsidian arm blades (1D6 DAMAGE)\nObsidian lava spear (1D6+2 DAMAGE, talos takes one damage when it creates one, 1 use)\nObsidian scales (1 ARMOR)\nFast, and ruthless\n\nGLASSBLOWER: The true form of this talos is lava. The talos can change any lava that is part of it or touches it to obsidian of any shape. With this ability it creates an obsidian based skeleton, armor, and weapons. Additionally, it can change obsidian back into lava."

    "text": "ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS\n\n\n\nThese are a form of land based deep sea anemone. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colours. Each of their tentacles looks like a flower giving the appearance of a garland of swaying flowers.\nAlthough they are plant-like in appearance they are actually solitary carnivores. They move slowly, hunting BURNACLES. Their ancestors would live by deep sea hydrothermal vents giving them resistance to high temperatures. They originate from THE GARDEN and are found in high concentrations there. However, they can now also be found anywhere that BURNACLES can be found.\n\nABYSSAL BUTTERCUP\n2HP | 0 ARMOR | TAC:0 | FRC:-1 | RFX:0 | CRE:-2\n\nLand bound sea anemone\nSimilar in size and shape of a fez\nFound in a variety of different colours shapes, sizes, and colours\nFlower like stinging tentacles (1 DAMAGE)\nFertilised eggs look and act like dandelion seeds\nSoft but fire resistant\n\nDEADLY-GARLAND: The diversity of the flowery shaped tentacles of one ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP is mesmerising. If a person stares at one they will become bonded to it, a person can only be bonded to one at a time. Whilst bonded the person will keep the ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP attached to the top of their head, unable to wear head gear. They will be attracted towards places with the ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP’S prey. If a suitable place is found the ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP will leave the host."

Building their homes on the ribs and spine.\nThe skeleton is infested with BURNACLES. They consume a lot of FLYTOPLANKTON, the OCTONUT CRABS like these creatures as they are not harmful to them and they keep other creatures away from the skeleton. The TALOES of THE GARDEN dislike this as it majorly decreases the amount of FLYTOPLANKTON to feed their ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS."

The 2 organisms are completely fused.\nThey live in huts built upon the great whale’s skeleton. These huts are made of:\n\nShells of the RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS.\nAluminium struts stolen from SKYSLIP.\n\nThe JUVENILE OCTONUT CRABS herd the RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS in the RUSTPLAINS.\nThe OCTONUT CRABS lay their eggs with the eggs of the RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS. For spawning the RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS go to the base of the rock outcropping at WHALEFALL. The surrounding ground consists of black basalt based sands. This keeps the eggs safe from the LEECH WORMS. However, the ICEFISH have started stealing these clutches of eggs for their own purposes.\n\nJUVENILE OCTONUT CRAB\n3HP | 0 ARMOR | TAC:+1 | FRC:0 | RFX:-1 | CRE:+1\n\n0.5m tall & 2 m wide (leg tip to leg tip) Coconut crab\nFusion of Coconut crab & Coconut octopus (physiologically & mentally)\nEyes of Octopus\nMouth area is the tentacle and beak of Octopus\nClaw strike (1D6 DAMAGE)\nSoft exoskeleton\nInquisitive & curious mind\nExcellent climber\nKeen sense of smell\n\nHERDERS: Once old enough juveniles are put to work by their bullying seniors.

They will primarily eat their RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS. They are surprisingly stealthy, able to burrow and live under the surface for days at a time."
